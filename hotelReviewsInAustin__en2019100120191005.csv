0,"Basically a La Quinta with a nice lobby. Nothing about the decor or the furnishings is 4 star. Room had cheap lamps/tables and pillows were small/flat. Linens were average at best, and general feel of room was cheap. Staff on the other hand was superb! Location mediocre. If you can stay here for $100 or under, ok, otherwise your overpaying.

1,"My husband and I were visiting our adult son, who lives in Austin, so I booked this hotel based on the reviews and the price (which was better than the downtown hotels). I did not realize that this hotel was in the middle of nowhere! We had to Uber everywhere and it was a 20-30 minute drive any place we went. In hindsight, we would have done better to pay more for a hotel downtown after factoring in the cost of all the Uber rides. In addition, there were things we found to be quite odd. For instance, the bathroom doors (there were 2) were louvered doors meant to be closet doors. In other words, it was not a solid door. Once you enter the bathroom, the toilet was separated by a curtain. Sorry....but I prefer privacy! In addition, the second day we were there, our room was never cleaned! The first day, it was not cleaned till 3:30-4:00 pm. You can not walk anywhere (like to a convenience store) because it is located right off a busy bypass so if you wanted a Coke, you had to pay $5 either at the mini-bar or the swim bar as there are no vending machines anywhere on the property and there is no ice machine (you have to call room service). Really, the only nice thing I can say about this hotel (at least for us) was the SIZE of our room and bathroom were spacious. I did not care for the decor (tacky Italian) and the staff certainly did not go out of their way to make our stay pleasant. We will never stay here again.

2,Trey is the embodiment of professionalism. I’ve been staying at the granduca with my boyfriend for an entire month over the last six months and Trey has been the sole reason we’ve been back over and over again.

3,"Fabulous location. A little out of town but it’s a short drive to downtown, malls and restaurants. If you would rather be closer to bars and restaurants then you may want to consider somewhere else as there’s nothing else around the Hotel. However, the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a conference at the Hotel and while the food was good they did run out during breakfast on occasion but this was sorted out quickly. Overall a lovely place to stay.

4,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel a couple of nights recently. It really is pretty...but the service was just not up to par with other hotels of this class. We had to ask 3 times to have our room cleaned one day. Although the pool area is beautiful, we never saw an attendant at the bar and people were having to call room service for drinks. That said, the valet/shuttle staff were excellent and as nice as could be!","May 29, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

The little chocolates on the pillow and bottled water were an added plus.:) Our shower actually stopped working in the middle of our stay and the hotel fixed it very quickly!

6,"This is a perfectly relaxing room, comfortable with all the amenities you could want. The only thing missing was the refrigerator. I'm sure we could have been moved to another room if asked. When checking in, Trey Foster was completely helpful and kind. The room had a little balcony overlooking the hills so you can get nice, fresh air.

7,"Good location on a hill. Small pool, Adequate room, with an old TV. Sevice is horrible: try calling room service and you get a call center and often have to leave VM.

8,"We arrived on a Friday at 4:30P, just after check in began. The line was bit long as the staff was dealing with two women who were haggling. I watched and listened to Jeffrey handle the pair so politely and professionally. They asked him at least a dozen times, ""Is that really the best you can do for us?"" (They wanted rooms across the hall from one another instead of down the hall as assigned.). Jeffrey was calm the entire time - everyone else in the area was very annoyed. We went to our room, unpacked, and returned to the lobby/bar area about 30 minutes later. The women were STILL haggling with Jeffrey. I watched him keep his cool the entire time while also checking in a now long line other guests. We visited with Jeffrey later, and he was so professional. Not one negative thing to say. Jeffrey is a Gem. In the bar and restaurant, we had the pleasure of being served by Ted. We throughly enjoyed him both afternoons/evenings. Such a nice man. Have a great visit at your family reunion, Ted!Room service was fantastic when delivered by Doug. His attitude and smile are outstanding! Our daughter had just graduated from college, and her friends had given her flowers that were laying on the counter. Without being asked, Doug brought a vase with water in it for her flowers! Talk about proactive customer service!Our bed was comfy. Our room was quiet. Short elevator waits. Friendly and efficient valet staff. Beautiful pool area with nice cabanas and drinks. What's not to love?Only one fail -- I requested balloons for our graduation celebration dinner in Visconti twice, and the manager assured me balloons would be at the table. Nothing. I was disappointed.We recommend Hotel Granduca when in the north Austin area.","April 29, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

9,I was so pleasantly surprised by this find. Even though I had researched and read previous reviews I was still skeptical. From the moment we were coming up on the curvy driveway overlooking the beautiful hillside I could tell this was going to live up to what others had to say. Front desk: Eduardo was so authentically welcoming. Room: Clean and spacious. Loved the high ceilings. Pool area: I felt like I was vacationing in a Tuscan Villa. There is no detail that hasn't been thought about. We can't wait to come back!,"April 19, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

10,"This hotel is tucked up and away on a hill off of 360. I had seen it while driving thru Austin multiple times, but had never had the opportunity to stay there. Fortunately, we had a series of meetings between offices that resulted in the Hotel Granduca Austin being the perfect location and it being selected as our hotel for the week. It is a lovely hotel with beautiful grounds. My room was spacious. It was stocked well with coffee, tea and a mini bar that rivaled most others I’d ever seen. Turn-down, towel and ice service was offered every evening as well. Towels were extra stiff, but other than needing some softener, no complaints about anything in the room at all. The weather was perfect during our stay. We were fortunate enough to have time one evening to sit out on the terrace as the sun set. That could easily become my favorite pastime. Such a beautiful setting!With the exception of the doormen that were incredibly rude to Uber driver that dropped me off when I first arrived to the hotel (they were very young and it appeared they were being judgmental and that needs to be addressed), all of the staff were fantastic. My only regret is that I did not have time to enjoy any of the amenities. I will definitely return and stay when I can enjoy without work obligations!","April 13, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

11,"Beware. The service here is non existent. Yes the building is nice. But the staff are not properly trained, they are arrogant, and rude. When asking a bellhop named Pierce if I could use one of the three available carts, I figured he would offer to help. Instead he said verbatim, “Oh we can’t let just anyone use these carts, these carts cost 4 thousand dollars.”How rude and unprofessional?Upon seeking resolution with the GM Olivier Glattfelder he ignored both my phone call and text messages. He clearly has no problem with guests being mistreated in his hotel.I then called the hotel and was put in touch with Ryan Dellimuth. I was told this was Pierce’s direct supervisor. It was a bunch of the same, he made no effort to resolve the situation and treated me as if I was no one.If you stay at Granduca Austin, you will see for yourself. The service is pathetic. They claim to be a 4.5 botique hotel. I have had better service at a 2 star hotel.Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. There are so many better options available in Austin.","April 4, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

12,"The hotel is beautiful, rooms are very nice. However we were made to feel like second class citizens at check in. When I went to check in and saw that we had one bed I asked if I could possibly have a room with 2 beds. I was told you booked through hot wire so you have to take the room we assign you. We have you in a handicap one bed room. I’ve never had anyone say anything like that to me when I check into a hotel. It felt very awkward. Like I had done something wrong. She said it nicely but still made me feel second class. ","April 3, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

13,"Charming and sophisticated, very spacious rooms. Environment reminiscent of an Italian Villa. We only stayed 1 night and weather wasn't mild enough for us to enjoy the open spaces, sitting in the internal patio nor enjoying the pool.

14,"We booked through Expedia and despite Expedia’s transparent price promise, we had to pay more than our Expedia confirmation stated. Although this has been due to taxes and fees (the room rate has been the same), had we paid in advance, they hadn’t had a chance to charge that. This is just a sign of sloppiness, either on Expedia’s or the hotels side. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with a “oh, you have booked through a third party web side!” So, does that mean; we’re less welcomed? Strange behavior. The whole “compound” where the hotel is located has no street side parking, no public parking and no means to get there with public transport. So, charging for parking is just a hidden room rate. I complained and the hotel staff took the parking fee off immediately. That was extremely nice and it shows that they do welcome our business. The roughly 9 miles ride to downtown Austin goes quick, even in rush hour. Overall, we were satisfied with the stay. Tip: once you have the Booking.com, Expedia etc. quote, check directly with the hotel. You might get a better rate by just calling them!","March 14, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

18,Nice surprise for this boutique hotel 7 miles from Austin downtown. The staff were all very attentive. The facility is beautiful. The restaurant was very good and the chef came out to talk to us. The bartender brought wine to taste. The pool area is pretty with a salt water pool. One of the maintenance person came by after adding salt to talk to my wife just so she would know they were not adding chemicals as she swam. The pool is heated to 82 degrees. David was at the front desk and if you see this hats off to you as well. I have never seen staff as attentive as at this hotel.,"January 19, 2019","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

In checking out this morning, however, we were informed that the hotel will no longer provide customers with a receipt for their room(s) if they booked through a third-party provider rather than directly through the hotel (which typically charges significantly more).

26,"I booked a Granduca Suite based on the website's description and pictures showing that it had juliette balconies and a soaking tub.Pictures and description on website ARE NOT accurate.What they show as the Granduca Suite is actually the Villa Suite and not what I preferred, booked or paid for.I made reservations well in advance for Saturday lunch at the hotel restaurant Visconti. I arrived to find the restaurant not busy with only about 4 tables of patrons and wondered why...... and then I discovered why.Waited 5 minutes for someone to show up at the hostess stand and then was seated at a dirty table where the half eaten breakfast dishes had still not been removed.Waited 10 more minutes for waters to be delivered all while still sitting at the dirty table.When the waters were delivered the waiter asked if I wanted anything else to drink. I requested a glass of Prosecco......which arrived 5 minutes later and was served warm.I tired of sitting at the dirty table with warm Prosecco and no menus so I decided to leave and go elsewhere in Austin for lunch.I returned to the hostess stand to find someone to tell them I was leaving and had left the full glass of warm Prosecco at the table and would not be paying for it.At the hostess stand I found 6 people waiting to be seated and an additional patron who had already been sitting in the restaurant with a group and had gone to the hostess stand to complain about their service as well.Deciding not to waste anymore time joining the other people lined up to complain -- I left.I actually live in Austin and thought that Hotel Granduca would be a great place to have overflow out of town guests stay as well as a wonderful destination for frequent in town ""stay-cations""Unfortunately it proved to be a very expensive and very disappointing experience overall.I will not go back and will not be recommending it to out of town guests.The hotel is beautiful but the service is greatly lacking and at least as for as the Granduca and Villa Suites go -- the descriptions ARE NOT accurate -- so be very careful when reserving a room.","November 6, 2018","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

The front desk staff, Trey, David, Mechaela and team, are the ""absolute best"" that I have experienced. During my recent visit, a gentleman that was checking in appeared to be stressing over not having his international charger with him, that is until the front desk clerk assured him that he would do all that he could to locate one for him, which I'm sure he did. The hotel rooms are always spotless and very nice. In my view, Hotel Granduca Austin is absolutely flawless and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

34,"My husband and I stayed here during a weekend getaway and it was beautiful. From the time we drove up until the time we left it was nothing short of Awesome hospitality. Location isn't bad and it's not hard to find. The drive up is a little intense due to the many turns but if you drive the speed limit you'll be fine. Parking-to valet it's $34/day but you can self park for $12/day. We opted to self park and didn't have an issue. We drove up so the valet staff could take our bags and then parked. If you take the elevator on the left side you will exit the same level as the hotel, it's an easy walk up. Service-it's very rare to get good customer service but this is one place that doesn't have that issue. The check in went smooth and we were given recommendations for dinner and brunch the next morning. The staff was friendly and helpful. Room- our room was gorgeous and fit the mood for the weekend. We wanted to be able to relax and the room allowed us to do exactly that.Food-we did not eat at the hotel but went to one of the recommended restaurants for dinner one night, Jack Allens. There was a decent wait time but once we got to our table everything went smoothly. I had the 13 spice pasta and my husband stuck to what he knew, a burger. Everything was to our liking, including the warm peach cobbler with ice cream on top. Pool-not large but a decent size, it was extremely relaxing and we were able to take a nap without any interruptions. Now that my husband and I know how easy of a drive it is from Houston to Austin we plan to take many more weekend getaways.

38,"My children attend The University of Texas so we stay in Austin hotels 10 times per year, Last night was the worst hotel experience that I have had in Austin or anywhere else that we have ever traveled. The fire alarms went off twice and both times the fire department arrived. No explanation was given by the hotel staff about what happened. After having to evacuate the hotel at midnight and again at 2:40 am I assumed that the staff would apologize at checkout and offer some type of explanation. I was wrong! No apology was offered. When I asked what happened, they said that they were ""investigating"" the matter. It is inexcusable for a 5 star hotel to treat guests in this manner. The owners and management obviously care little about customer service. Austin is a great city with a large number of upscale hotels to chose from so I will be taking my business elsewhere. This ""5 star hotel"" certainly does not come with 5 star service. How did they get their rating???","August 19, 2018","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

39,"I had such high hopes with the Granduca in Austin, architecturally tasteful, and well appointed furnishings, but the staff and service, well...that's another story. In order to be put into a room with 2 double beds I was upcharged an additional $30/night. After a long full day of meetings, the woman working at reception gave me the wrong keys to our room which meant a second trip downstairs. You can valet park for $36/night or self park for $12 a night. We opted for the self parking. We ordered room service the following morning, pancakes (lemon ricotta) which were very tasty, and a frittata and apple smoked bacon, All tasted delicious, but for those two dishes with a pot of coffee we were charged just under $90.00 USD. Extremely pricey for what what it was. Saturday night there were two fire alarms (false) one after midnight, the other at 2:40 a.m. Which required having to walk down 8 flights of stairs. I cannot image the elderly guests managing this very easily. The hotel is understaffed, and some of the staff they have are not very well trained. It's unfortunate as I'd like to stay again because of the location, but honestly there are a lot of other amazing properties in Austin that aren't overpriced and have much better trained staff.","August 19, 2018","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

43,"This is really a great property! I got a great deal through Travel Zoo as well. The hotel decor is very pretty and the rooms are spacious. Like others have mentioned, the rooms are very clean, and I'm a very critical hotel guest. The pool, while on the small side, is nice and the cabanas are available at no extra charge (usually unheard of nowadays). However, I did have a few complaints -- the 1st was my safe wasn't working properly. We were gone the whole day, got back around 3:30 and my room hadn't been cleaned yet. We were headed to the pool and I didn't feel comfortable leaving iPads and my purse in there without the safe. So I didn't get my room cleaned. Granted, they left a note stating they tried but didn't since I left the privacy sign out. I probably could have gotten another safe but it would have been a hassle. The 2nd thing that was a little annoying were the door greeters or lack of. We self-parked (which is an awesome free service there) but I felt a little slighted that we weren't greeted each time we arrived and no one offered to open the door? I know, I know, 1st world problems but this is pretty standard at most high end hotels. Lastly, I thought it was weird the server in the pool area never asked me or my daughter if we wanted anything to drink or eat. The self serve water station was nice touch, but I would have totally had at least (2) cocktails if asked (!) Granted, I felt bad there was only (1) server in the entire pool area and she looked busy but there's a huge opportunity to add servers out there to make money when you have people in the pool. Especially in July. Oh, and they ran out of towels (huh?). Good thing we brought our beach towels down there. Again, these are small details. But it would have turned our experience from really good, to really outstanding. But this hotel is definitely worth staying at -- it's great and the views in that area are wonderful.","July 30, 2018","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

45,Just finished a great weekend at the Hotel Granduca. The hotel has beautiful Italian old world charm. The rooms are quaint with tall vaulted ceilings so they feel very spacious. The bathroom was large with a great big shower - excellent for couples! The self parking cost $12 which seemed odd and was not connected to the hotel but otherwise great stay. Close by within a few minute car ride is Wild Basin Preserve. It made for an excellent morning and walk - great views of the rolling hills in the area. There is also a scenic overlook only couple minutes drive that gives an excellent view of downtown Austin (especially gorgeous at night). Really romantic getaway. ,"July 22, 2018","0    Hotel Granduca Austin

51,"I was looking for something within easy reach of downtown Austin, but with a rural feel. This sort of does it. Better on the inside than out, on approach its a frankly unpromising 9 story block just off the highway, on what is basically a business park with a multi-story carpark. Rural views... not really rural. But its pretty nice once inside, 4-star is about right. And staff were excellent. I booked a room with a balcony (from the description on this site actually....). But (in short) they have no rooms with balconies, unless you count a full length window with a rail on the far side. Not something you can sit out on & relax - or at all. But on asking about this at check-in, I was upgraded to a suit, so I can’t complain. The only other negative was the bar next to the modestly sized pool. Despite great weather and being the weekend, it was open only very short hours, meaning to have a drink I had to request room service by the pool - slow, and with very high charges. Why? Cutting back of staff maybe? Overall, an enjoyable stay and I would consider returning when in the area, mainly for the great staff. But I would also look at alternatives.

Instead of calling to check on when our room would be ready or offering other accommodations, the front desk personnel acted as if we were inconveniencing her by asking for an eta on when our room would be available. Secondly, it is hot in Texas and like us, many people were enjoying the pool. However, there was no service at the pool. They never opened the bar and we had to track someone down for food and drinks from the upstairs restaurant. The waiter that delivered the food was very nice and helpful and even commented how ""they forget about people outside"".

The hotel is shaped as a “U” with a pool in the middle which is nice. The staff at the hotel is friendly. We got the choice if we wanted a room close to the pool or with a view to the city and choose room close to the pool. We had a room with two double beds which are of good size and clean. Room contains fridge but no microwave, safe or water heater. Breakfast is included in price and for being an American hotel it is good (below average if you are used to European breakfasts). You can have waffles, egg and bacon, fruit, sandwiches, juices etc. there is also a small gym and self laundry. The pool area is nice and calm and you do not hear the high way, a small oasis. All in all we liked the hotel. If you are disturbed by a high way close or wish to live in the city center this might or be for you. ","July 13, 2019","1    Aiden by Best Western @ Austin City Hotel

84,"Hotel prices in Austin can be very very high. When I booked our room here the price was quite a bit below what other nearby properties were charging. Therefore I was concerned that maybe there was some issue with this hotel. But, I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel and our room. Parking was easy although the roads in this area seemed to be busy during our entire stay. The room was clean and everything worked just fine. We had a room on the inner courtyard near the pool and that could be a noise issue depending on who the guests are. It was not an issue during our stay. The complimentary breakfast was fine as well. I like the rate we paid and would consider another stay here in the future should the chance occur.","May 1, 2019","1    Aiden by Best Western @ Austin City Hotel

89,"Firstly the hotel ones not give clear directions (does not say which exit to come off) on tripadvisor or website on their address section. Secondly upon arriving at the hotel about 1pm after a 200 mile drive. I had requested an early check-in which I know can not be guaranteed but upon walking into reception it was evidently clear that your main receptionist really did not want to assist us and was glaring at me. She said the room was not going to be ready for another hour (given the emptiness of the hotel I really do not believe this to be true) and the other girl who was next to her was just interested in eating her snack. I said we would sit round the pool til it was ready, she said nothing. When we got to the pool we couldn’t gain access as you needed a card. When I went back to reception she said we weren’t allowed around the pool until we were guests and her and her compadre starting laughing as I walked off. So basically the hotel expects guests to sit around in reception until reception decides you can have your room. In the end I had to pay money to get on my English WiFi ( as no doubt I couldn’t have WiFi access either until I was an official guest and to be honest by this stage I didn’t dare ask)I have travelled extensively around the world and have really never felt the need to complain about a receptionist but first impression is key. She never smiled at us or greeted us once in passing during our three night stay whereby all the other three hotels in various places in Texas could not have been more different with helpful and cheery staff. Therefore I would not recommend this hotel - I do not know why lonely planet recommend it in its guidebook and I will be complaining direct to the Wyndham Group for lack of service and customer care.

94,"We arrived at the hotel at 5:30pm to check in to our room and we were advised that our room was not ready despite being nearly 3 hours after the scheduled check in time. We were understanding and the gentleman at the front was very apologetic. We were told it wouldn’t be long and to wait in the foyer until the room was ready. Soon after 30 minutes had passed and we hadn’t had any further update. After speaking to the same gentleman he informed me it still wasn’t ready but another 15 minutes and we would be fine to enter. We were provided a coupon for a free entree for the restaraunt next door as a result of the delay. Another 15 minutes passed and still nothing, after heading to reception again we were told the room is nearly done and was presented with our room check in keys and told we would be right to head in at at 6:50pm. We arrived at the room at 6:50pm to find the room still in the cleaning process, we waited another 10 minutes before heading back down to reception again. Finally we were given an upgrade and were provided access to another room. This room was quite nice, spacious, clean and ticked all the boxes that guest look for in a hotel. The downfall of our experience was that we didn’t get into our room until 7:15pm which was over four hours after check in was opened. We saw other guests upgraded before us and the disappointing part for us was that we were told wrong information on multiple occasions. A lesson for the future is so be upfront with guests and if there is going to be a 4 hour delay, try and offer more then just an entree to apologise.","April 9, 2019","1    Aiden by Best Western @ Austin City Hotel

95,"Stayed here over the weekend with my wife for a concert. Good location just off 35 and straight shot down Oltorff to backdoor the airport. We had debated on a car or Uber and turns out rental was best. Drive was about 6 to 10 minutes to shopping on South Congress and another 5 to get downtown. Grocery stores, pharmacies, shopping and restaurants are all close. The hotel and room was very clean. Everything is a little smaller and darker than what shows on the hotel’s website, but it was overcast during most of our trip. The room was Immaculate and provisions were the usual but good quality. The king size bed and pillows were soooo comfortable. Although just off 35, did not hear much traffic. We did not eat dinner at the attached restaurant, but complimentary standard breakfast was fresh and hot (except for the cold foods). It seemed to be pretty cool with live music and a fully stocked bar. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Starbucks is about a block away and the hotel backs up to residential areas which were nice to walk. It was too cold to swim, but the pool area was nice and stocked. The gym was nice quality and the hotel has a funky layout with a Southwestern decor. Only downsides i noticed were some of the jets in the hot tub didn’t work and the access turning left from Oltorff onto the hotel street was challenging sometimes. For the value, would stay again, especially versus pricier mid tier hotels downtown.","April 4, 2019","1    Aiden by Best Western @ Austin City Hotel

The complimentary breakfast was very good for a continental type and the staff working the breakfast were very attentive and helpful. My only issue is that we got a room in back of the hotel. A big garbage truck came to pick up the trash at 5:45 a.m. and made plenty of noise. Also the staff must have been pushing their carts around in the back area to get things ready for the day and that made plenty of noise too. However, I was already awake from the garbage truck so maybe that was why I could hear the carts so clearly. If you book a room there, I would not take a room in the back area.

116,"One of the most iconic hotels in Texas, with a great location right on Sixth Street (right at the beginning of ""Dirty Sixth""). The rooms are small and the bathrooms tiny, but the beds are great, the AC cranks loudly but strongly, and the bathroom vanity is more than large enough for a well-stocked couple. Love the bar, one of the great bars in Texas, live music most nights, just classy and comfortable. Also love the huge veranda/balconies on the Sixth Street and Brazos sides - great for that late-night cigar you suddenly just have to have. Fair rates in the mid-200's, but $40 to hold your car (ouch!!). The breakfast/brunch place is excellent, always have to catch at least one meal there. You know, if it's really all about location location location, this can't be beat. You're only 10 feet from the throngs on Sixth Street each night, but inside it's quiet and cozy - you'd never know it.One last thing: If you're thinking of staying here or anywhere else downtown, be aware that the homeless situation is completely out of control. I'm a big guy and I was accosted every block or two, and if you're a woman you may be a little scared to walk around at all. One guy in a wheelchair lunged at my wife and barked at the top of his lungs when she tried to walk past him, scared the crap out of her.

119,"The Driskill hotel is like a step back into an elegant time. The hotel retains the opulence and details of 1886 when it was built. We stayed in a smaller petite room which was beautiful with high ceilings and period woodwork. Bed was comfy with nice pillows. The bathroom was a bit cramped but we didnt mind as it was part of the experience of staying here. The hotel bar had live music and a nice relaxed atmoshpere with plenty of places to sit and relax with a drink. Breakfast in the 1886 cafe and bakery is not to be missed. While I was initially hesitant about the valet parking, it was very efficient. When you want your car you just text your ticket number and your car will be out front in less than 15 minutes. The hotel location is perfect for checking out the capitol building and grounds, the action on 6th street and walking up and down Congess Avenue. We will be staying at the Driskill again when in Austin. One caveat is that 6th street is blocked off on Friday and Saturday nights so if you drive back to the hotel late, be sure to come from the congress street direction down east 5th to Brazos.

121,"So we stayed here on a weekend trip from San Antonio because we wanted to go to Franklin BBQ. My fiance picked this hotel because of the decor she likes the colonial style. The inside has an old fashioned colonial feel and is open and looks nice. The lady at the front desk was very short and to the point not very nice or friendly. To get to our room we had to take two separate elevators in two different parts of the building. It was like walking through a maze trying to get in and out from our room. The rooms themselves were clean but very small, especially the bathroom. The beds are very stiff and hard so unless you like sleeping on a SUPER firm mattress this is not the place to try and sleep. The pillows were just as bad one of them was so thin and soft it like split the filling when you laid your head on it and it was equivalent to just laying your head on the mattress. The other pillow was just as firm or firmer than the mattress itself. Only reason why I would recommend you to stay here is if you want to party it is right on 6th street but there are much better options for the same price just a block or two away.

My wife and I wanted to be right there at that spot. So for that it was perfect. I guess my rating of average means that the room was clean and comfortable, there was a tv, a coffee maker, clean towels, and good service. Thats what 300 bucks a night gets you in Austin! Seems like you should get more for that much, breakfast not included. They wanted to charge an additional forty bucks for breakfast!

Our room had chocolate covered strawberries and champagne to celebrate our wedding night, which we loved. The room was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Nice sheets and great AC.

We had a great breakfast in bed- strong coffee, eggs Benedict and a Texas shaped waffle. The room we stayed in overlooked 6th Street, which was (to be expected) noisy on Saturday night. Our hallway was quiet and we slept great. The staff were all friendly, quick to help, and efficient. The only negative was when we ate brunch Monday morning at the 1886 Cafe.

135,"You can read the very interesting history of this hotel in the room guide. Unfortunately I have a terrible memory so I can’t remember much of it, but it was interesting! This is a gorgeous historic hotel - I think the oldest in Austin - that has had presidents visit and even wait out their elections. There is fabulous memorabilia in the hallways on each floor, from the original owners. Also lots of beautiful paintings. The mezzanine is huge - great place for a wedding or other large gathering. The lobby is gorgeous - lots of marble. The main restaurant is sadly closed Sundays and Mondays (the nights we stayed) but the bar & grill had amazing buffalo wings, although the service was a little slow. The breakfast restaurant also had wonderful food, and great service. The main thing I noticed was the pristine condition the hotel is in. You can tell it’s been recently updated (carpets, drapes, etc), but it still has the feel of an old hotel. I believe it may have housed one of the first banks in Austin (don’t quote me on that). It has an original bank vault in the lobby with the original safe deposit boxes. ","June 4, 2019","2    The Driskill

Because of its ""historic"" nature the rooms are not all similar in quality. Rooms that end with ..01 are next to the lifts. Room 421 has huge air conditioning units outside the windows which means for people who are sensitive to the sound of a ""jet engine"" landing in your room, best to avoid it. Having said that the staff did their best to re-accommodate us and were fairly pleasant about it. We were shown a room that had no view with frosted windows so that you don't look out at a brick wall. Check the room before settling in.

We arrived in Austin a little earlier than check-in time and I called to ask if they had toiletries because our luggage was left behind. They told us that they did and that we could check-in at the time of the call if we liked. I use a wheelchair and when we got there, the room wasn't accessible because I booked through a third party and they weren't notified that I requested an accessible room, however, they looked in the system and found a room that worked for me. It was close to the elevators and the entryway was wide and the bathroom had a ton of turning space. The space on side of the beds were also wide.

210,"We stayed here for one night while hitting some “horror” related stops on our road trip to Texas Frightmare Weekend. We arrived late and we checked in quickly. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Parking was easy to get and was included in our stay which is a plus. However the toilet in our room ran constantly but as we were exhausted from being on the road we didn’t bother to call down as being moved was more trouble then we wanted. We just closed the bathroom door and blocked it out. The wifi was poor and barely worked but again it wasn’t an expensive stay but seems in 2019 this should’ve been better. Room also had no fridge, or microwave which makes me wonder what the plus stands for over a standard Red Roof. Free coffee in the lobby was the extent to a breakfast available though I no none is offers at this hotel seems strange not even muffins.

Beds were very comfortable (I had two - even though just me in the room).And even though I don't have a pet, I liked that it was pet-friendly and easy to clean with the laminate flooring instead of carpet. Shower worked well and lots of Hot Water. The room has great height - like 10 ft ceiling.The price was far better than many other hotels nearby and I think this hotel is just as nice. The swimming pool was well cared for and warm enough.They don't have breakfast here and that helps keep the price down. There are many breakfast places nearby so that is not an issue.I did not order any food yet they have a reasonable price menu for room service in the room.I really liked the way that the TV has a wake-up feature on it. Instead of using the old style alarm clock which is in the room, I used the tv wake up system - it just turns on the tv when the time is reached that you set. And Free Parking - with what I saved by staying here - my rental car was covered with those savings.I plan to stay here again when I come back to Austin.","April 9, 2019","3    Red Roof PLUS+ Austin - South

Then when we checked in we noticed a sign that said water would be shut off the following day from 8am-5pm, due to the city of Austin shutting it off. When walking to our room, the stench of marijuana roamed the hallways, so we immediately went downstairs to voice our feelings. Sandy jumped into action and heard everything we had to say and handled the situation so positive and professionally. She apologized for the inconvienance and offered us accommodations in a different room. If it wasn’t for Sandy I probably wouldn’t have gave a 5 star review.

There’s a free car park within walking distance which is extremely handy. The hotel is also walking distance to all local bars and restaurants so ideal location.

The room option of a Double King is ideal for our family of 4 (I wish more hotels offered this type of room), and the beds are SUPER comfortable. A special shout-out to housekeeping: I needed a baseball uniform cleaned, and they did a great job of getting it clean (no easy task) and promptly returned to our room, pressed and hanging in the closet when we returned from a day of games.

259,We stayed here on a Saturday night for a weekend surprise getaway. The classic room was very nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Even staff in the hallways were friendly and helpful or greeted you. It is refreshing to stay at a hotel where you can tell that the employees enjoy their job! My one suggestion if you stay here is get a room on the front side of the building. When we stayed our room was on the back side of the hotel. The back side of the hotel backs up to nightclubs and bars down the street. The noise and music from those nightclubs was so loud! The bass from the nightclub music felt like it was hitting our window until 2 am. I don’t mind noise and we didn’t go to bed early but 2 am was late for the noise. I imagine if you stay on the front side the noise would not be a factor. Great hotel overall excellent staff.,"June 9, 2019","4    Archer Hotel Austin

This is hands down the best hotel in Austin ... and that’s coming from a native Austinite who loves a staycation. Exceptionally friendly team who goes out of their way to make everyone feel like a VIP - including my two littles. Warm welcome, nightly turndown service with delicious treats, stylish accommodations in a suite that will rival any top hotel. Nespresso makers, in room games, rubber duck in the sunken tub, cozy throws to snuggle by the patio fireplace and a well stocked mini bar. Whether in town for business or pleasure you’ll love your stay here. Domain NORTHSIDE also offers excellent dining options (recommend Perry’s Steakhouse for dinner or Bakery Lorraine for a treat) and a wide array of shopping. Archer Hotel is inviting, luxe and a perfect escape from downtown. Sit by the fire in the lobby and enjoy a nightcap before retreating to your room.

Helpful, genuine and designed to please. The restaurant is reallyyyy good! The rooms are modern and tasteful (not awe shocking luxury) but great for the price point.

265,"My husband and I booked a room here through their website. There was an option to ""let the hotel pick a room"" for a lower rate. I rolled the dice hoping we would like ""their pick"". Upon arrival, we were given one of the nicest rooms........we were thrilled! The room was clean as a pin, roomy and it had a balcony. The tub was huge!! Frankly, it was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. The customer service was excellent, everyone was so friendly and helpful. We were there celebrating my birthday. Much to our surprise, they delivered a bottle of wine and a cheese plate to help us celebrate! Thanks again to all the staff at the Archer.The location was very good too. There is a Whole Foods store just a few blocks away, lots of unique restaurants to choose from, a Nordstrom and other really nice stores, all within walking distance. The parking arrangement worked well for us. They do have valet parking available but guests also have the option to park their own car (for free) in the parking structure nearby, which we did. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks.","May 8, 2019","4    Archer Hotel Austin

266,"What a wonderful hotel! From staff, to the rooms, to the pool area to the restaurant and bar - this is a top notch hotel. My wife and I stayed for two nights in April 2019. The hotel is small, but offers many amenities of a larger hotel. The staff was friendly and efficient. The pool area was pristine and the pool was one of the cleanest I've ever seen at a hotel. The poolside staff was also excellent. The bar and restaurant were also very good. My wife commented that the bed in our room was the best one she's ever slept on. I would agree. The location of the Archer is ideal for anyone who wants to eat and shop, too. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Viva Spa. They took excellent care of my wife as she enjoyed a spa day during the trip. We will definitely be coming back to the Archer. I can't recommend it enough.","April 29, 2019","4    Archer Hotel Austin

270,"The Archer Hotel is absolutely stunning. The employees are kind and welcoming. I work in hospitality at another hotel here in Austin. My fiancé (now husband) and I chose this hotel because it was number 1 on Trip Advisor. With both of us being in the business, we wanted the best of the best for our wedding night. We booked a gorgeous suite (for top dollar and booked directly as we prefer). The suite had a large soaking bathtub and canopy bed. I’ve never had the luxury to stay in such a stunning suite!I truly wish I could have given a better rating. The reason I’m giving this rating is I’m disappointed that there wasn’t any champagne or chocolate covered strawberries - something tasty and extravagant to welcome us on our Wedding Night! When I booked the reservation, I added notes that it was our wedding night. Then I called the hotel to confirm and I stated that it was our wedding night and I work at another luxury hotel; however, I chose the Archer because it was number 1. The agent I spoke with said that they would doing something for our special occasion and because we chose their hotel over another or even my own hotel which would have been for a minimal discounted cost. At my hotel where I work, when a guest calls about any sort of celebration, we always send champagne or chocolates to the room and include a personal card. We work hard to make last memories. Once again, it was just disappointing to not receive this same service when I expected it from another top rated hotel. All in all, the hotel is still stunning and the people are very warm, but if you’re looking for a “Wow” moment then I am not sure you are going to get it here because I didn’t.

275,"Luxury hotel that hit all the right notes. My girlfriend and I stayed here during one of the weekends of SxSw. We weren't in town for the festival but rather to celebrate a special anniversary. From before we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful with email and text reminders. Check-in was easy, room was great (everything was clean, well stocked, and comfortable). The bed and pillows were really comfortable and the bathroom decor is a little above traditional hotel bathrooms so that was nice. The only problem which is nothing against the hotel but we had a bit of a noisy neighbour (likely due to the festival and wanting to keep the party going in their hotel room). When we asked to switch rooms the staff was exceptional. They made sure we were fully satisfied with our stay that they moved us away from the noise and even bumped us up to an upgraded room at no charge. On top of that they comped our breakfast the next day (a $50 charge for free). I was very pleased and so was my girlfriend. It made for a great and memorable stay. I'd definitely stay again and it's a great reflection on how this hotel values customer satisfaction. Highly recommend. ","March 22, 2019","4    Archer Hotel Austin

From the staff, to the decor, to the location - it has everything we want in a hotel!Before I get into the review, a huge thanks to Nate on reception who was outstanding. We saw him as we checked-out to continue our Texas adventure, and he gave us invaluable advice for our mini road trip. We had a great chat with him, and his passion for Archer hotels has definitely put the brand to the top of our list when we next stay in the US. We were sadly only there for three nights but would have loved to stay longer. We checked in fairly late on the first night after a long flight, and it was wonderful to get to our room after it had been ""turned-down"" - it felt so warm and cozy, and we had delicious treats waiting for us. The bed was incredibly comfortable and had exceptional linens, the bathroom was perfect with excellent Malin and Goetz toiletries, and it was so lovely to have slippers and bathrobes to wear in room.We didn't get an opportunity to eat at the restaurant, but we did get room service which was outstanding. It was also far too cold to go out to the pool, but we could see it from our room and it looked great! We chose the King Suite which we found very spacious with an additional seating area - I definitely recommend this room. There is plenty to choose from in the mini-bar, and a Nespresso coffee machine if you don't feel up to the walk across the road to Starbucks! There is turn-down service which, as already mentioned, comes with curated treats (although we did only get turn-down service for two our of the three nights, but this is literally the only negative from our stay, and is such a minor thing!). The 'gift shop' was so unique, so make sure you check it out - right by the main doors, the cabinets are full of local Austin souvenirs, but not the normal items you'd find in any other hotel. Such a creative idea. The whole Domain Northside area is great, with easy free parking on the 3rd floor of the Nordstrom lot behind the hotel, or valet parking if you prefer. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area if you don't feel like driving downtown. You will not run out of things to do here very quickly.We had such an amazing stay - the Archer is definitely our number one place to stay in Austin.","December 2, 2018","4    Archer Hotel Austin

Make sure you get a room with a patio so you can enjoy the outdoor fireplace (they even have a blanket for snuggling by the fire if it is cool out). The bed and linens were very comfortable. Frankly, the room itself is one of the nicest I've experienced. As far as the rest of the hotel is concerned, it is very nice but nothing extraordinary. When we arrived I had unloaded my bags before I was approached by anyone for assistance and when we left getting our car from the valet took a long time.The hotel is located in a very cool area with many good restaurants and bars to choose from. It is a great place to get away with a SO for a long weekend.However, if you are planning on going to downtown Austin for anything this is not a good area to stay. It took us an hour and a half to get from the hotel to the Odd Duck (S. Lamar) for dinner on a Friday afternoon (we left at 4:00). I suppose if you work around traffic hours you could make it work but traffic in Austin is dumb anyway so why waste any time in the car if you don't have to.

Two king size beds that were so plush and dressed with high end linens. Bathroom was modern and well appointed. Already booked return visit with husband for next month. Perfect for a quick getaway.

308,"Derek and James are hospitality. They excel at anticipatory service and made my business stay better than most business stays. Derek was friendly, he's knowledgeable, and informative. He also takes time to ensure the location of my room is comfortable for me. James has great conversation and was on time to shuttle me to and from work... even when I forgot to tell the front desk agent of changes. Today, I'm in town for my 2nd business trip in the last 3 weeks and when I arrived, Derek had my favorite jacket (that I'd left here 2 weeks prior). Both always had a smile on their face. Oh, and one night I needed my food reheated and the microwave wasn't working properly in my room, Derek urgently took care of it. In addition the service, the hotel is clean!! The breakfast was fitting, organized, and clean. I forget that gentleman's name that was manning it, but he was super polite. He looked to be doing a lot, even dumping large bins of garbage. Everyone seemed to be on their game. I'm looking forward to 2 more stays in the coming weeks and more later in the year.

Seems they just wanted us to leave? They new we had paid in full on Orbitz. After some dialog they found another hotel in the area (30 minutes away), and told us to come back tomorrow for the remainder of our stay, so we did. This hotel is loud. Caters to large events (corporate, weddings, etc). The bar is overflowing, large groups walking past our room all night. Before booking a hotel look at its location on a map. This hotel is next to Costco. Trucks and backup alarms all night. We will not stay at a Holiday inn or use Orbitz ever again. Note: I am 57 years old and have traveled all over the world.

The manager went out of her way to make sure everyone was served. I had a special request for an ice bag and she dropped what she was doing to assist. The room was spotless and comfortable.

321,"Four night stay. Very comfortable hotel. Nice appearance in lobby, lounging, and breakfast area. Great big screen TV in lounge. VERY friendly front desk staff, like super Texas friendly; being from Los Angeles...it is just a breath of fresh humanity air!!! Two Queen Bed Rooms are comfortable for family of four (two adults, two teenage boys). Nice 42 inch TV with good channels. Bathroom clean and good. Desk for writing or laptop work. Perhaps only short is no real place to put luggage other than on ground. There is a low bench with a soft foam top but wheels on our bag would leave dent so we didn’t use; guess if you have a smooth bottomed suitcase or bag it would be fine. Nice, free Happy Hour Monday to Thursday 5-7pm albeit no drinks for the kids. Pool area comfortable and enjoyable and has a couple gazebo spaces with outdoor TV’s if you fancy. Pool temp great in this sweltering July Austin heat. There is also a jacuzzi. Alcohol and smoking is allowed in pool area but inside hotel it is a non-smoking facility. Pool area has lots of lounge chairs, tables, and a bathroom. No outside shower. Greenbelt behind pool area makes area feel more rural and relaxing. North Austin location is good with close proximity to many restaurants including BBQ, steak house, Mexican, Indian. Close to Lake Travis, about 23 minutes from here. Hotel is located in back of a small strip mall with Costco next door (cheapest gas) and a Wendy’s and a pizzeria in front. On other side of 183 are lots of restaurants too. Parking is free but it is part of the strip mall out front. Overall, we like this place, glad we chose it, and have felt welcomed and comfortable. Would recommend.

It affected my sleep as I’m already a light sleeper. I don’t know is problematic of all the rooms, but any times I stay there I’m the future, I want a top room.

When I got back to the room, someone was trying to get our TV to work and had been attempting to fix it ever since I left.

The 2nd night, the folks directly above us apparently brought a herd of elephants that were about to knock our light fixtures out of the ceiling - you think I am exaggerating, but this is a pretty accurate assessment of the noise level. Anyway, after about an hour of this, I picked up the phone to call the front desk and guess what - we might have had a TV that worked, but we didn't have a phone that did. Anyway, the elephants left for several hours, only to renew their efforts to dislodge the light fixtures well after bedtime.

Bathroom was clean. Towels were like brand-new. The breakfast is decent not fancy but good enough. Closed to many restaurants, but you need a car (don't forget you are in Texas).My room was not facing to the freeway, so it was quiet.

360,"This Fairfield Inn has nice appeal without the downtown prices. The modern rooms were clean and comfortable, but on the small side. The bathrooms are large with large walk-in showers. The hot breakfast met my needs with scrambled eggs, omelets, vegan and pork suasage, fresh fruit and cereals. The hotel website advertises Asian entrees, but I only saw white rice as an Asian entree (side). Instead of regular HBO, the hotel has HBO GO where you can browse HBO series and movies for replay. My only problem was that the hotel sits along side of I-35 and the road noise kept me up throughout the night. I tried using the hotel ear plugs supplied in the bathroom, but the low rumbling noise on semis going down the freeway woke me up consistantly. My recommendation would be to request a room furthest from the freeway. ","June 2, 2019","6    Fairfield Inn & Suites Austin North/Parmer Lane

When I called on Monday the young lady who answered the phone pretty much called me a liar I told her that I had the email confirmation and she still didn't believe me. My brother told me just to leave it alone they they may need the money more than we do. Never once did they try to offer anything to us not will take a lot to take off a night stay. I wasn't looking for a thing for free. But to be called a liar I have a problem with that I have a huge problem with that this Fairfield needs to step it up I will let everyone know never to stay at this property and to all of those who read this please make sure you check your accounts because they will take your money and not refunded.,"January 29, 2019","6    Fairfield Inn & Suites Austin North/Parmer Lane

374,"I was invited to speak at SXSW at the very last minute was able to get a room at Fairfield Inn & Suites Austin North. Understandable, due to SXSW, most downtown hotels would have been fully booked, so this was the next closest option even though it is about 10miles from the Austin Convention Centre. The room rate was at its peak pricing due to the event but on the positive side, the room was clean and a decent size. It has a large shower but shower lacks pressure. Breakfast was provided but had a limited selection. Coffee and tea was provided all hours of the day. In the morning they serves the better quality Davidoff coffee which is which a pick me up for my daily commute to downtown Austin.","December 29, 2018","6    Fairfield Inn & Suites Austin North/Parmer Lane

375,"The place is under construction. We recently stayed in room 227. The room smelled like mildew and was in the 80s when we walked in. There was an old soap in the shower so i assumed it hadnt been cleaned properly. My boyfriend went down for breakfast the next day and it was empty and had a funny smell. He asked the lady if they were going to add more or refresh and she said it shuts down at 9 am, which was a lie, it's 9:30 am. I had to request new blankets because ours were dirty. My boyfriends parents were staying in the same room, but they had the 4th floor and it was newer and smelled better. So if you are going to stay request the 4th floor, it was the same room with a microwave and updates. We had loud banging from the construction that began at 8:30 am. It was directly on top of us from the floor above. They should warn the guests of this. We had no warning. I also requested bags which were never brought up. I had to go down and get them, but the manager did refund me little points. Overall, I would never stay here again.","December 27, 2018","6    Fairfield Inn & Suites Austin North/Parmer Lane

We had to carry all their stuff up stairs. It was not acceptable that they didn't offer a room down stairs or even offer to help.But the kids liked the waffles for breakfast and the pool.They definitely do not hold up to the Marriott name.I expect to see a credit of some sort because of the inconveniences.

403,"I would personally like to acknowledge the outstanding service of William ""Will"" King at the Fairfield Inn Austin N location. He went above and beyond the service levels we've been experiencing these days. I did completed a survey and shared with Marriott.com so please read those comments and recognize Will in a positive way.My sister, almost 88 yr old mother and my 23 yr old niece decided to take one last summer trip to visit our 95 yr. old cousin and to go outlet mall shopping in San Marcos after a morning of shopping in Wimberley so as you can imagine our hotel budget was small to allow more $$ for our shopping excursions. When I booked the room online, it was described as 2 queen beds, when I was reviewing just before booking, it said ""double room, double beds"" so I called the number provided, reached Fairfield Inn and verbally verified beds were indeed queen sized. I even asked for the mattress measurements and was told 60"" X 80"" (queen). When we arrived and checked in, the beds were indeed full and not queen. I'm 5'8"", 235 lbs and am smallest of our group with exception of my mom at 5', 145 lbs so you can understand our need for the bigger beds if we're sharing! Anyway, Will came to our rescue after a long/hot day of driving and visiting family - offered several alternatives and then since something was wrong with the agreed upon roll away bed, he offered us a second room complimentary which we graciously and happily accepted. Best stay ever!","July 26, 2018","6    Fairfield Inn & Suites Austin North/Parmer Lane

415,"Stayed June 2019 for a conference. Hotel is new, nicely appointed for millennials. No pool. Titanium member breakfast voucher to Caroline coffee shop for breakfast for $20 a person up to two people. Breakfast was very good with several tasty options. The Caroline bar on the second floor is awesome. Great happy hour deals. Always very busy after work. Hotel needs a service elevator. Highly annoying how many times the elevator stops on each floor and most of the time I was on the elevator it is full of hotel employees. Too late to install the service elevator, but poorly designed in that sense. Almost wouldn’t stay here because of it, but Caroline coffee shop and lounge would be the only reason to entice myself to stay again. Austin has a severe problem with the homeless. I travel all the time for work and in my short walk to the convention center each day, I was aggressively approached by homeless asking for money. I never experience this in any other city to the magnitude that it happened in Austin. Nothing against this hotel or the location of the hotel as it’s a city problem. I would not come back to Austin until this homeless issue is figured out. ","June 27, 2019","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

417,"We stayed at the Aloft during SXSW. Having never been to Austin, we didn't know the area at all, but did know this would be central to most everything we wanted to do, and we're fans of the Aloft brand. It was more perfect than we could have imagined, and we were able to walk to just about everything! We only took Lyft twice, when we were going a few miles away.The staff here is amazing, extremely friendly and helpful. Both Caroline, the on-site restaurant/cafe/lounge, and Upstairs at Caroline, its more trendy counterpart upstairs, are much-better-than-average hotel bars (I reviewed them both separately) also. Aloft hotels always have fun touches, and this one offers Bliss toiletries in a convenient dispenser in the shower, as well as ""Boots to Borrow"" down in the lobby, which I loved.Some reviewers disliked the location because of noise and a large number of homeless people. Personally, when I'm staying in a large city's downtown area, I'm not looking for a quiet stay, so street noise wouldn't bother me a bit. Having said that, we didn't hear much actual noise, outside of occasional sirens, and we were only on the 8th floor. We enjoyed looking down and people watching when we were in for the night, and there was a lot of activity to see, but noise was not an issue. Our room also had amazing blackout shades that we used when we went to sleep, maybe that helped. As far as the homeless population, maybe the police were more on top of it because it was SXSW, but we didn't see more than just a handful.Overall, if you want to be close to everything in this part of town, stay here!","June 24, 2019","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

418,"One of the things I like most about the Aloft brand is that you know exactly what you're going to get. Aside from common spaces, the hotels are outfitted in almost exactly the same way. The rooms are modular and slightly dorm-roomish, but here, as in other Aloft hotels, the vibe is modern and a little chic and there's plenty of space. The bathrooms will not appeal to the luxury-crazed, but they're perfectly serviceable. And that's what I like most about this Aloft (and others)--when you reserve a room, there will be, for the most part, no surprises. This hotel has buzzier common spaces, and the dog-friendly policy makes it ground-zero for pet-toting travelers. None of that bothers me, but if you're looking for a more serene, or dog-free travel experience, you'll want to check other options. The elevator situation (lobby is not in the first floor) is slightly irritating, but we never had to wait long to get upstairs, so, all in all, it wasn't bad. The location is great--very near the capitol. We'll be back.","June 3, 2019","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

The location is just perfect - a half a block from 6th and close to everything.","April 4, 2019","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

434,"I chose the Aloft downtown for my daughter and friends to visit Austin for the weekend due to its’ central location and being a new Marriott property. Due to the SXSW crowd building and the political speeches in action, downtown was quite busy. Yuriko contacted me to see if there were any special requests before arriving. I requested a 2P early check in knowing the hotel had a 3P published check-in hoping they might be able to accommodate. Their room was a bit delayed, as they received the keys at 3:20P, however, Yuriko and staff did upgrade the room to a corner on the 28th floor with great views of the city, extended a $20 credit for the bar and hand delivered a gift bag to their room after they were settled in. My daughter and friends texted and said the hotel had a great atmosphere, well decorated and energy due to the staff. Tucker texted me this morning to ensure her stay was going well and asked if there was anything he and the staff could do this morning to ensure they had everything they needed. Yuriko, Tucker and staff extended a 3P late check out and went above and beyond. I will choose the Aloft downtown location the next time I visit Austin!","March 10, 2019","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

438,"I travel to Austin quite a bit for work, will pay almost all price points, so I'm well-acquainted with Austin hotel properties. My #1 preferred hotel in Austin is hands-down the Aloft Austin Downtown (which shares the building/floors with the Element hotel, a sister brand, so my common-area review could apply to both). The rooms are consistent with the Aloft brand. Not huge or luxurious, but always comfortable and practical. I jokingly refer of Aloft rooms as ""luxury college dormitory"" style, but this is said with complete affection.The Aloft Downtown Austin differentiates itself by the experience. A stay at the Aloft is truly an Austin experience, of the fantastic kind. While a trip to Austin might be for work or other responsibilities, almost everyone also wants to experience the famous Austin vibe and experiences. The Austin vibe is alive and well at the Aloft Downtown Austin, you almost don't even need to leave the property in the evening (but eventually you should, of course!). The property is the epitome of cool, in the fun not obnoxious way (I'm too unhip for obnoxious properties).Caroline (1st level) and Upstairs at Caroline (2nd level) are great places to dine, drink, relax and have fun. Tellingly, both are filled with locals. Caroline has great coffee/baked goods/breakfasts, and then offers great food and drinks during the lunch and dinner hours. Upstairs at Caroline opens late/mid afternoon, depending on the day of week, and is a playground of fun, with great outdoor space and game tables by the bar - and they have great tacos (!), and I'm picky about tacos. By the adjacent reception desk area, it's a quieter but still very fun place to sit with your work emails and enjoy a scene - if work emails can be described as fun. The staff is unfailingly polite, friendly and service-oriented. A really impressive team. You can even rent cowboy boots at the reception for a night out at the country bars and dance halls (hello, Broken Spoke)! That sorta says it all about the Aloft Austin Downtown.While you're in the heart of Austin's entertainment areas, try to visit the city's great cultural experiences. The new-ish Austin Library is extraordinary in design and experience, and you will feel like you're really part of the Austin community - it's like a community center for the locals, just brilliant. The University of Texas museums are world-class and not to be missed if you have the time: the Harry Ransom Center (amazing! the 2nd largest archive only to the US National Archive in Washington DC), the Blanton Museum (largest university museum in the USA, largest Latin American art collection in the USA, and second largest European art collection only to the Smithsonian), and the LBJ Presidential Library (stunning, and make sure you take the elevator to the top floor for the Oval Office experience, plus great views).","February 24, 2019","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

445,"Stayed at Aloft for three days over MLK Jr. weekend. My husband and I are legacy SPG customers and used our annual free night for two nights and points for the second night. However, Marriott's booking system is terrible - I had to call customer service only and they had to book 3 separate reservations. When we arrived at the hotel, they could not merge all 3 reservations, so I had to go down each morning to ""check-in"". I don't blame the hotel but Marriott's poor IT integration due to the merger - it's been months and there are still issues on that front.The Aloft is great - we had a standard room with double beds and it was enough for this small family of three. The bathroom was a nice size with a large counter - the water pressure needs some work; shower worked fine but the sink was horrible. The room (and hotel) were spotless. Had a wonderful view of the State Capitol on the 31st floor. The only two complaints: Caroline's is a fantastic spot - breakfast was great but if you want coffee and a pastry to go, the line can get really long. This building also houses Element and I think the to-go area is too small and can't accommodate the influx of guests. The second complaint, parking is outrageous at $47 (incl tax) a night. I'm from Los Angeles and hotels DTLA don't even charge this much - these prices are San Francisco and NYC prices. While Austin is a lovely town, it's nowhere near these two metropolitan cities. There is a parking garage to self park down the street but that was even $30 a night.","January 28, 2019","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

I’m not a fan of 2 in 1 shampoos. The water was softened, so it did help a bit. Beds were super firm, pillows mushy and unsupported. Needless to say I didn’t sleep well. Valet parking only and $45 per day! Kind of a cluster to get in and out. The second floor bar was happening. It rained for a few days so all the fun stuff on the balcony area was closed. Bummer. It looked super fun. Breakfast on the 1st floor was good. We had vouchers to eat, otherwise super pricey for breakfast. Unique and tasty, but $$$. All in all it was good.

452,"Full disclosure: I am in the travel business. Stayed here on Nov 16th for 2 nights. The hotel exceeded expectations in some areas, fell just a little short in others; but on the whole….two thumbs up. Check-in and check-out were quick and very efficient. Our room, as well as any public area we saw, was immaculate. Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and professional. Lounge area is very popular, so much so that it was extremely noisy. Hotel has a nicely equipped, and really not too small, fitness room. Room service arrived quickly and food was hot. However, our request for extra napkins was overlooked, forcing us to use bath towels when eating a (generous) order of wings. (Hope the laundry was able to get the stains out!) Complimentary newspaper and bottled water in the lobby were most welcome pluses. We thought it odd that we were told the hotel has no ice machine, and that ice would be delivered to the room upon request, since we found an ice machine ready for guests’ use on the second floor. As our stay was quite brief, we did not use the Housekeeping service, so cannot comment on this. Had a lovely corner room on the 29th floor with a great view of the state capitol building. Being so high up, we heard little street noise, but think lower floors might be problematic in this regard. This is, after all, a downtown hotel! Location is outstanding. Used car service to get to the restaurants on the south side of the Congress Ave. bridge, but took a leisurely walk back from there to the hotel without any problem. Plenty of nearby places to dine. One design flaw we take issue with (here and in other properties) is room lighting that requires way too much light to be on in order to have any light at all in the potty area. Very disturbing to sleeping partners. On the whole we consider this a fine property, and I will be happy to recommend this hotel to clients going forward.","November 24, 2018","7    Aloft Austin Downtown

I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to wait long for an elevator, as the hotel is over 30 floors. It seems that the Aloft and Element should combine into one property instead of keeping them separate, confusing people checking in and figuring out where to eat. Not a huge deal, but it seems unnecessary now that Starwood and Marriott are merged. The food in the restaurant (Caroline) was good, the service not unfriendly but not overly friendly either.

Rooms - I'm not Aloft's target audience. It was one of the only places I could get so I didn't have a choice. Rooms are really small!!! Luckily the floor to ceiling windows help to lessen the clastrophobicness of the room. Mattress is good enough to get a decent nights sleep. Pint sized closet. If I was only paying $100-150/night, I wouldn't be so critical, but I was unlucky and everything was sold out. I got shafted in having to paying $350/night for 3 nights. This is NOT a $350/night hotel by any means! The service, quality, decor, and room are not at that price point by any means! If I was at the higher end property ~4 blocks away then it would be different. Elevators were fast, but the interior doors had huge restaurant advertisement...really tacky!

The bed was extremely comfortable. The service was very friendly and professional. There is a restaurant/bakery/coffee shop (Caroline's) in the lobby. I did not eat there but they also have a second floor rooftop bar, I did visit that and it was very relaxing/entertaining for an evening drink and conversation with co-workers. The complimentary hotel breakfast was above average, I suspect the Caroline's restaurant downstairs supplies some of the egg burritos and pastries, all real good. Also for right after work the hotel has a complimentary cocktail hour from 5-6:30 providing wine and a selection of local craft beers, as well as light snacks of bread, olives and cheese. This is great before venturing out for dinner and then coming back for a nightcap at the rooftop bar. All followed by the comfy bed to charge up before another day of work.

468,"We brought our daughter to orientation at UT and chose to stay here because of the proximity to campus and where we needed to be on the first day of orientation. Hotel is good--room was clean, beds comfortable, AC cold, plenty of towels, decent coffee for breakfast. Water pressure was meh, but I can look past that. Pool could've used a sweeping or two, but it wasn't terrible. There aren't any restaurants in walking distance, so know that you'l have to drive or Uber to get places. It was a 15-20 minute drive (in morning Austin traffic) to the UT campus. Workers were friendly and readily available. They have a little mini-mart store that you can purchase snacks, drinks, etc. We have many trips to Austin in the future, and we will look to stay here again. Advice to management: with how the pool is situated, get some tables with umbrellas to block the scorching afternoon summer sun. ","June 23, 2019","8    Super 8 by Wyndham Austin/Airport North

Instead of checking to refill empty food choices, employees got coffee for themselves then sat down to visit until time to clean up & close down the breakfast.

471,"I booked this hotel because of the Sleep, Park, Fly feature. I'm from Waco and had an early morning international flight. I requested the 4 a.m. shuttle the night before as is requested by the hotel, despite having everything squared away I woke up the next morning and was told the shuttle wasn't running that morning and that I'd be reimbursed for an Uber. The Uber ended up being $12 and some change -- the clerk offer me $12 -- which is no big deal, but I have a feeling that would not be acceptable if our roles were reversed. I ended up leaving around 4:15/20 -- not too far off schedule, but sometimes that slight difference does make an impact -- next time I will come down earlier just in case it happens again. Upon my return, I called for a pick-up and it was quick and easy -- no problems.It was conveniently located close to the airport. The room was fine, but average. Water pressure was lacking in the rooms, but could be fixed easily. I would book again because its the only Sleep, Park, Fly hotel near the Austin airport.","April 2, 2019","8    Super 8 by Wyndham Austin/Airport North

We stayed there a couple of days, so it got better or we just got use to it...lol. The second let down was our room/reservation, I originally made the reservation here on TripAdvisor, but called the hotel, because I needed to make a change & wanted to make sure I got the correct room. I reserved the larger 2 queen room, but was given the smaller. This was after getting there and them giving me a king room. The pics on the site are totally different also, I was expecting a room with a full kitchenette, like the hotel site shows. The room had a mini fridge and microwave, so not sure if they have rooms shown on the website. They do have themed rooms, our first room had a swing in it and it had been used extensively....lol. The overall hotel needs to be updated, it was fairly cleaned, but it showed age & wear/tear. The complimentary breakfast was just ok also.

497,My stay at your hotel was very disappointing. Although the room was nice and I was comfortable my interaction with the staff as less than than I had expected. It all centers around being double charged for the room. The company I.work for ( MOT) booked the room for me through expedia and pre paid for the room so all I had to do was check in on arrival. When I arrived the desk clerk asked for my drivers licensed a credit to put on file which I did. After getting to my room I received a text alert from my bank Well Fargo that sper 8 had charged my card for the room $69.20. Not understanding why my card was being charged since the room had already been paid for I called the front desk and asked what was going on. I was informed that my card had not been charged and I was mistaken. So being confused I. Called my banks. service line and was told that yes super 8 had charged me for the room so I went to the front desk and shoed the clerk the alert from wells Fargo and explained to him I had called the bank to verify. He told me I was wrong and asked him to look into it further. After a couple of hrs with no reply I called the front desk to find out what was going on and was told that he had spoke to his manager that there had been an update on the computer system that sometimes charged a customers card but that when I checked out the next morning that the money would be returned to my card. The next morning at 4:30 am I checked out to catch a plane back to Tucson As and spoke to the new clerk at the desk about the double charge issue. She told me she had been made aware and called the company to fix the problem. I had a early flight so she said she would e mail me as soon as she took care of the issue and had my money returned. After arriving in Tucson several hrs later I checked my e mail and found no response so I called the hotel and asked to speak with the manager. After being connected to her she was not all resposive to my issue going back to the line that my card had not been charged and there was nothing she was going to do to help me. I felt she was very rude and could care less. I asked for her supervisors phone # and was told she was it. After that I called wells Fargo and filed a claim against super 8 for double charging us for the room. The service member at wells Fargo once again checked and verified that I had indeed been charged for the room and intiated an inquiry which is suppose to take 10 to complete.

510,"This is a good hotel for the price. The Super 8 affiliation really does not do this place justice, as it is more of a hotel along the lines of a Best Western or Holiday Inn than it is a typical Super 8 ""motel"". The room and hotel itself were quite nice. As other reviews have mentioned, free gift baskets containing water and snacks are in the rooms (although they are not refilled). I didn't try the breakfast. Unfortunately I did encounter some problems while staying here. I came to check in at 3:00 PM, checked in with the front desk and was given my room key. When I got up to my room and was about to enter it, a maid in the hallway told me that it wasn't ready yet and I would need to either wait or get a new room. This was not mentioned at the front desk at all. In addition, the screen outside my room's window was detached and so wind would blow it against the window making a tapping sound which was somewhat annoying at night. There was no shampoo ever placed in my room (just two bottles of ""lotion"") so I had to go down and get shampoo from the front desk, and lastly the wifi would frequently go down temporarily, sometimes for periods as long as 15-30 minutes.While this is a very good hotel for the price, the issues I had above have convinced me to look elsewhere for the time being for a cheap yet high quality hotel in Austin.","May 1, 2017","8    Super 8 by Wyndham Austin/Airport North

511,"Friendly staff, clean, average motel breakfast fare. We stayed in a handicap access room, with a roll in shower. The two shower heads needed to be replaced. Hardly any water came out of the fixed sprayer, while the hand held sprayer had water spewing out of the top of the hose toward the ceiling. It was so out of control, it would spray onto the floor outside the shower, which made the tile very slick, like stepping onto wet glass. We had to use all the towels each day, to put down on the wet floor, to keep from falling. Outside of this problem, the stay was okay. We didn't complain to the desk because the motel was fully booked during our stay due to motorcross races. We knew we couldn't get another room. I also felt the room prices were over rated for what we got, due to this being a busy time for them, they were able to do that. I should also mention there was a spa tub in our room, which was very nice, but noting the fact this was a handicap room, there were no grab bars around the tub, which made it almost impossible to get in and out of. This facility is leaving themselves at a huge liability for that, plus the out of control shower and wet bathroom floor.","April 28, 2017","8    Super 8 by Wyndham Austin/Airport North

516,"We stayed here for two nights on my cross country bicycle ride. I was taking a rest day in Austin so that's why we stayed the 2 nights. In Texas the frontage roads are all one way so you often have to drive miles out of your way to get to someplace that is 2 blocks away. This is the case for this Super 8. This hotel is significantly nicer than most Super 8 hotels. There is no pool. With this once exception it is comparable to the Best Western hotels we have stayed in recently.Austin can be expensive and this place is more expensive that we like to spend but it was nice. Large clean, modern room. There is a Jack-in-the-Box next door. I'm not sure that is a plus but at least you have one option for food without leaving the hotel.The breakfast had protein not just carbohydrates! Always a plus for me.Bottom line, much nicer than your average Super 8.","April 3, 2017","8    Super 8 by Wyndham Austin/Airport North

517,"A bit of construction going on two sides of the hotel, but sleeping was quiet. Check in was fast and courteous. The lobby design was a bit confusing. First look, beautiful then it looked like a few pieces were left over from someone college days and randomly put in the lobby. The few pieces really take away from the initial design. We had a king sized bed for two. The room was very large and spacious. It had a large screen tv and a sitting area with desk. They even offered a lap desk, if you wanted to work in bed. The bed was VERY comfortable. You had a choice of pillow comfort too. Only down side to the room (205) was the plugs on the lamps did not work or were to loose to even hold the plug. So, we couldn't put our phones by our bed. The desk lamp wasnt working either. Shower in our room had water saving shower head. So, for someone like me who has a lot of hair, I believe I wasted more water than saving water. The breakfast area didn't feel clean. It wasn't dirty but it didn't feel clean. The tables weren't wiped down. The milk I used had been sitting out to long. The decaf coffee button had a special technique needed to use. I had to ask the breakfast attendant, who didn't seem happy to be there that morning. On the flip side, coffee was good once it was up and running. Lastly, a door binger kept going off the entire time we ate. It was rather annoying. We actually cut our breakfast short and headed back to our room.","March 27, 2017","8    Super 8 by Wyndham Austin/Airport North

518,"THE RESERVATION I booked my room online at super8.com. Because I have dietary restrictions, whenever I am staying in a hotel more than a night or two, I prefer to book a room that includes a kitchen area so I can prepare my own food. I was booking a room for 9 nights during SXSW in March so I definitely wanted a room with a kitchen. I made a reservation on their website for a One King Bed Non-Smoking EFFICIENCY because it included a kitchenette area. The photo representing the room that I booked showed a small kitchen area in the room. When I arrived on a Thursday night to check into my room, I was given a key to a STANDARD One King Bed Room and NOT the EFFICIENCY that I had reserved. I went back to the front desk and told them that there must have been a mistake. The woman working the front desk looked confused and then picked up the phone and walked into a back room (so I couldn't hear) and called the manager of the hotel. However, I have very good hearing and could hear everything that was said on this side of the phone conversation. The manager told her to tell me that my room was not available when it was booked. Can you imagine???MY ROOM WAS NOT AVAILABLE WHEN IT WAS BOOKED. How is that even possible? How do you let someone book a room in a hotel when the room is not available in the first place? That is pure false advertising and a bait and switch scam because I would have NEVER booked a room in this hotel in the first place if one was not available with a kitchen. In addition, I booked this room TWO MONTHS in advance. The hotel had TWO MONTHS to contact me about the reservation and tell me that the room I booked was not available. They never did. They even called me the DAY BEFORE I was to arrive to confirm my stay and again they said NOTHING about the room I booked not being available. That is a COMPLETELY unacceptable way to do business. I told the woman at the front desk how unacceptable that was and that I wanted to stay in the room that I had paid for and that if I was not going to stay in that room then I wanted a severe discount on the room that I was staying in. She crunched some numbers and then told me that what I was paying already included the discount. I told her that what I was paying for was an EFFICIENCY room and not a STANDARD room and because I was not staying in the type of room that I had reserved, I should be provided with a discount. She told me that I would need to contact the manager and that the manager is not in during nights or weekends. I told her that I should not have to be inconvenienced by having to go out of my way to track down the manager because it was not my fault that they screwed up my reservation. They were the ones completely at fault and as such requested that the manager contact me instead. I left my name and contact information. Needless to say, the manager NEVER made any effort to contact me at all during my stay.My schedule was so tight and fully booked because of SXSW that I did not have any time to try and find another hotel to stay in nor would it have been easy or even possible considering that all of the hotels in the area are booked to capacity during that time.THE ROOM There were some stains on the furniture as well as on the decorative pillow on the bed. The rug was old. The vanity in the bathroom was 37"" high. A standard bathroom vanity is about 32"" high. This bathroom was made for someone about 7 feet tall. I'm 5' 7"" and felt like I needed to use a stool if I wanted to brush my teeth or wash my face in the sink. I can't imagine how someone smaller than me (like around 5 feet tall) would ever function in that bathroom. Forget about trying to get close to the mirror to put on eye makeup or anything, there's no way with a vanity that tall. They did have a pull out makeup/magnification mirror on the wall but that was mounted at a height of more than 6 feet which was way over my head so that was totally useless also. The water pressure on the shower was so bad, it felt like standing under a dripping faucet. I would NEVER stay in this hotel again. CLEANLINESS: PoorBED: ComfortablePILLOWS: All small.

526,"Our flight into Austin was a bit delayed due to the weather. With that said we arrived at the hotel somewhat later in the evening. The receptionist was a very friendly and helpful young lady. She gave us a few dinner recommendations that we decided to explore.Once in the room, we found it rather small; however, with just my husband and I more than adequate for our three night stay. The room seemed clean, my only gripe was the shower floor did not appear clean. Rather than complain we opted to wear a pair of flip flops (shower shoes) while bathing. This is the main reason the hotel received a ""good"" rating rather than a ""very good"" rating. Other than the shower, the bathroom appeared to be well maintained.The breakfast each day was great for meat eaters, two different types eggs, bacon, biscuits with sausage and gravy. A variety of pastries, the infamous Texas waffle irons- which my hubby couldn't get enough of . Lucky for me they also had fresh whole fruit i.e. bananas, apples along with cut fruit like various melons- watermelon, cantaloupe etc. Also included was tea, coffee, apple and orange juice. The kitchen staff spoke to us each morning and was also friendly.My husband used the gym. It was very small but he was able to accomplish what he needed for a workout. We swam in the pool, which was also small but nice because it was indoors and we did not have to tackle the Texas heat ☀️.Prior to our departure we washed our clothes in the onsite washer which was $2.00/ to wash and $2.00/ to dry. The dining room was a cute little area to watch television or to borrow one of the books from their cute library.If we were in Austin, we would probably stay here again- just be sure to take shower shoes.One item of note is for traffic for downtown.

535,"When I travel I either stay at a Marriott or Club Carlson property-- because I'm a rewards member with both hotel chains I get lots of benefits & rewards such as ""late check out"". However on Aug. 19th most of the properties in Austin were booked so I searched for alternatives and since I had never stayed at a ""Sleep Inn"" I decided to try them. After a long 4 hr drive from Dallas I was super tired so I couldn't wait to get checked into my room, upon check in I was very impressed by the professional and friendly customer service I received from ""Blair"". Unfortunately the ac in the room was not working properly and as we all know in Texas cold ac is a MUST! Blair was kind enough to change me to another room and he kindly apologized for the inconvenience. I slept like an Angel in that comfortable bed, breakfast was great with plenty of choices. After such a great breakfast we ended up laying back down and didn't get back up until 12:00 noon. My husband asked the front desk for a late out and was told by the lady at the front desk ""you're already past your late check out"" and it was only 12:00. My husband was shocked at her comment as well as her attitude and tone. We're not use to that kind of rudeness so we will NOT be staying at another Sleep Inn again.

No hot tub, but the pool was perfect for my family. Later I went looking at brochures in the entry and John volunteered that if I was looking for kids activities, we should hit Mt. Playmore. He named some others but suggested MP due to the kids' ages. I thought it was super nice of him to volunteer that, but I wanted to kiss him the next day when we went! It was amazing and my kids died of happiness. Breakfast was a little different every day but always had eggs and meat hot as well as biscuits and gravy, muffins, bagels, fruit, yogurt and waffles.

Room was very clean and quiet. AC worked great, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable! Left early for the race, but stopped by breakfast for a quick bite. I've stayed at many Comfort Inns, Sleep Inns and Quality Inns all over the country and this one had the best breakfast by far. Lots to choose from and a big space for dining. Doubt I'll be back in Austin anytime soon, but would stay here again.","April 9, 2017","9    Sleep Inn & Suites N Austin

543,Stayed here during Spring Break and SXSW (which was not intential). The hotel was vert accessible from several highways which eased dealing with Austin traffic. Lots of restaurants close by.

544,My wife and I stayed in a king size bed room. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The shower was different than I had seen before It was like a little alcove. No shower curtain It did have a very good multi setting shower head. The negative was the space between the furniture and the foot of the bed. and the location of the chair in the room. When my wife drove her mobility scooter in there was no place to park it without being in the way. This is the first room we have stayed at that we had that problem. The chair was in a corner but you could not oben the night stand drawer because the chair was blocking it. They offered a really good breakfast each morning with eggs and sausage and biscuits and gravy as well as make your own waffles. The staff was very friendly.But the way the room was arranged and the lack of space was a never stay at a Sleep Inn again from my wife.,"March 15, 2017","9    Sleep Inn & Suites N Austin

545,"My mother booked a room for herself, my sister, my daughter, and myself. Our reservation was for 2 nights, booked at a prepaid discounted rate. Everything was fine until the day after our first night. While out for the day, my mom received a call from the hotel informing her that she would be charged an additional $60 for ""dye stains"" that were on some of the towels. None of us dyed or have colored hair. Upon arriving back to the hotel, we were shown the items which were not dye stains at all but makeup! It also included two pillow cases which had makeup and one with a head stain from hair product. She was told the towels could not be cleaned and could no longer be used. The front desk associate said that this was damage to hotel property! My mother is a world traveler and me domestic and NEVER have we heard of a policy such as this! After receiving the initial phone call, we called Choice Hotels customer service who said the properties are individually owned and have their own policies. To avoid any further issue, my mom purchased towels from Walmart which we slept on and used for showering. Upon checking out our invoice did not reflect any additional charges. However, the anxiety and frustration the situation caused was irreversible. It spoiled the remainder of our outing and caused us to skip a nice dinner. We feel as though they were using this as an excuse to get more money or racially motivated. This was completely unacceptable and we will NEVER stay at this establishment again or recommend it to anyone!","March 14, 2017","9    Sleep Inn & Suites N Austin

The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars are two things: upon arriving, the front desk person just gave us the key and did not tell us where the room was.

567,"The Sleep Inn & Suites is a great value while you're visiting Austin. It was a little further out of the city than we would have liked to stay but still only a 10 - 20 minute drive to downtown attractions. The money we saved staying here versus downtown was well worth it!The staff were rockstars, the night before we left I used the lobby computer/printer to check into the flight online. Silly me forgot to take the boarding passes out of the printer but when I woke up the next morning they had been slid under my door with a note from the Front Desk! Room was clean, breakfast was great. My only little, little complaint was that the fitness center was very warm. I am a runner and I like to put in a couple miles before starting my day, I think since the fitness center was located right next to the pool it got a bit muggy and warm in there.

It takes a minute to warm up. This shower requires that you face the shower spray as you turn it on. This is not a tub with a curtain - it is an open shower with a solid wall on three sides which you must approach from the fourth side. Take your clothes off first and expect to wake up immediately when that cold water hits you.","February 25, 2016","9    Sleep Inn & Suites N Austin

Good warm continental breakfast with eggs, bacon/sausage, waffles, muffins/bread, juice/tea/coffee. Staff is very friendly and helpful. There were sufficient parking spots and the lot was well-lit. However, on our first night, my partner was stuck in the bathroom as he could not open the door. Took 15min for the maintenance guy to come help break open the door. The maintenance guy used a few tools but the door was still locked. My partner ended up breaking the doorknob himself by hand and found his way to unlock the door. The hotel manager gave us an ""upgrade"" to a suite (which basically was the standard room but bigger and included a couch) but did not offer any free nights or discounts.Overall it was a good stay but would recommend anyone who stay there to check if the bathroom door works (our upgraded room's bathroom door could not lock). It was a good value hotel but had to only give 4 star with the unpleasant lock-out for over an hour and hotel's limited help and offer afterwards.","February 16, 2016","9    Sleep Inn & Suites N Austin

570,"I recently stayed here for four nights traveling alone to do research in the Austin area. I chose this hotel based on the great ratings, the price, and the location. It's fairly convenient to get from here to downtown Austin even during the height of Austin rush hour. Just a simple turn or two and you're on the interstate in either direction, since it's located on an access road. You can get to many food options via surface roads, as well, which is nice during high traffic times. Overall, I found this place quite nice, especially considering I've never stayed at a Sleep Inn (or any Choice brand franchise) before and had no clue what to expect. The bed was comfortable, the room clean, housekeeping consistent and careful, common areas neat and well-maintained, shower decent, plenty of room to create a workspace in the room when needed. The breakfast was a pleasant surprise, as well. Lots of options that rotate each day, constantly replenished, and I loved the Texas-shaped waffle maker! Adorable. There was free, fresh coffee available all day and evening in the lobby, too, which saved me some money and time that would've otherwise been spent going to buy coffee elsewhere. The staff was also nice and accommodating across the board, too. There were a few issues, however, that I feel warrant mentioning here. The first is that I booked a King Standard room, and requested a quiet room on the highest floor. I got the highest floor no problem, but my room was about as close to the interstate as you could get in the hotel. I could've dealt with it, though, to be honest: the hotel is far enough off the road that I don't think the noise would've been too troublesome, and I'm very sensitive to noise. But the real issue is this: the room I was assigned smelled. Like, BAD. It was kind of a mix between smelly leftovers, musty air conditioning, and old vomit. That's the best way I can describe it. I stayed in there about an hour, got unpacked, and told myself it wasn't really as bad as I'd initially thought. Well, it was. After an hour in there my throat started hurting. So I went downstairs and told the front desk clerk, who said I could switch rooms to a Double Queen across the hall (apparently the King rooms all face the road in this hotel, and the double queens face away). He even made sure he got me a room right across from the smelly one so I wouldn't have to walk too far to move all my stuff. I appreciated that. I did, however, get charged an additional $10 a night for the new room since the Queen rooms cost more I guess. Personally I kinda think I shouldn't have had to pay extra since the old room was so gross, but whatever I guess. The new room smelled clean and fresh, which it should've considering I was paying more for it. Also, I will note that the walls between the rooms are pretty thin. I didn't have any issues with neighbors until my last night, when the World's Loudest Couple checked in next door and I had the privilege of hearing them argue with each other and on very lengthy phone calls with others until around midnight. I would've asked to switch rooms again at this point, but it was my last night and I was ready to just leave so I dealt with it. If it'd been any other time during my trip, though, you better believe I'd have requested to move. This was not, of course, the hotel's fault, so I mention it only so other guests can be aware that noisy neighbors can potentially be a bit noisier than normal in this hotel. Lastly, if you're using a personal credit card to pay for your room here, a word of caution. I've had about $250 of pending extra charges show up on my card over the past couple days from the hotel beyond what my invoice said I owed and what I originally paid. I don't know if it's for incidentals or something and the charges will disappear, but if not I'll have to call and get some answers soon cause it's a bit excessive. We'll wait and see I guess.Overall, this is a nice updated hotel in a safe area. The staff were all friendly and it had several perks that other places in this price range wouldn't offer.","February 6, 2016","9    Sleep Inn & Suites N Austin

Since we had two cars, that was $90 a night for a total of $270. Totally ridiculous especially since their communication with me confirming my stay made no mention of these additional fees. Since these parking rates are so high, I believe they should be disclosed up front. Have to say it ruined my weekend!","June 28, 2019","10    Four Seasons Hotel Austin

583,"Stayed here for one night on 6/21/19. I hate having to write this review. I love the Four Seasons and have stayed at the Four Seasons in Houston, NYC, Chicago, Orlando, etc. and have always had a wonderful experience. I can't say the same for the Austin location. A few things really stick out about my sub-par experience. Upon arrival we walked over to the reception desk. The women working the desk appeared friendly but I soon realized she was not trained to run the front desk. The best example I can give is when she said ""sorry I'm just not that familiar with reservations"". It all went downhill from there. She kept apologizing- literally apologized 7-8 times. It was overkill and made me uncomfortable. After a brutally long check in experience my boyfriend and I were ready to go upstairs with our luggage. The bellman had placed our luggage on a cart. They pushed the cart into the building from the valet and expected my boyfriend to bring the luggage cart upstairs himself. Weird. Having just had such an uncomfortable experience with the front desk I didn't want to deal with them again so my boyfriend and I just pushed the huge cart upstairs by ourselves. I should mention we had a great experience at the pool. The waitress was friendly and kind- she was wonderful. Brought us water without us asking. Also a great experience with the valet and breakfast service at the restaurant. Later that night we ordered dinner for 2 to our room. No waters were brought up for us. The kids pizza was not good, tasted like it had been made hours before and just recently reheated. No turndown service. Just overall we had a crummy experience. Such a shame especially for paying 600+ dollars for a room per night.","June 21, 2019","10    Four Seasons Hotel Austin

The hotel restaurant, Ciclo, was a pleasant surprise. The meal was excellent and the service was also very good. The hotel facility and the room were adequate. The lake view from the balcony was a bit disappointing as would have been the construction views from the city view rooms (but perhaps we'll try that view on the next visit).It seems that the additional cost of nice hotels primarily delivers exceptional service from their staff - and that is the value comparison left for the guest.

594,"Great location, very nice lobby and grounds, good A- staff. My room was on the small side for a luxury hotel. If you book here, it's worth the ~10% upcharge for a “lake view” room (request floor 4 or higher). Otherwise you'll get a “city view” which overlooks the parking lot and a construction site. Worse yet, there are several tall buildings just a few feet away, and it seemed like “city view “ meant “city views you.” I don't understand why rooms don't have a set of sheer drapes to afford some privacy while letting light in— the only drapes are the heavy ones. Also, the FS seems to host lots of outside events (weddings, benefits, etc) which can pose an inconvenience to hotel guests.There are lots of good hotels in Austin.","May 4, 2019","10    Four Seasons Hotel Austin

L'occtaine products in bathroom are really good.Gym is great and spa services are exceptional. One major downside is the access to the outdoor heated salt water pool; you have to walk in your robe from the spa which is on one side to the other side as there are no separate changing facilities such as a pool house to change into your swimsuit.

614,"Subdued, maple toned and utterly Texas, the Four Seasons Austin is a robust luxury property right on the river. The lobby cocktail bar is always hopping, and the restaurant downstairs offers a sophisticatedly restrained take on American cuisine with a strong Texas undertow.The rooms continue to the butterscotch palette. The beds are firm, the linens luxurious. The bathrooms provide plenty of room for two people to get ready at the same time, or one person to have an unwinding time before getting ready to face Congress, Sixth Street or the State Capitol.Beyond a state of the art workout room, there is a walking trail along the river that passes by the hotel for a beautiful run/jog/hike. There is also a boathouse within easy reach. AND at sunset, watch the bats fly from under the bridge.As a respite from Austin's go-go-go pace, this is the old school brand of luxury. Many newer properties have been built, but none matches the Four Season for elegance that's as cozy as it is sophisticated.","February 26, 2019","10    Four Seasons Hotel Austin

633,"This is a place that is probably the bottom of the Hilton line. It was clean but not fancy, the furniture was econo level but servicable.We had made the reservations a week in advance (we are Hilton Diamond Members) with a king size bed only to find out when we got there that the room was overbooked and not available. They upgraded us to a ""suite"" with 2 queen beds to make up for their mistake, it was quite spacious but not what we wanted. There were packs (6-9 kids) of children running in the halls after 9pm making loud noises, yelling at each other & slamming doors for at least an hour, we were about ready to call the front desk but they finally quit at about 10:15. The parking lot was very dark, there were no parking lot lights on when we returned from dinner, even though they were available, the hotel is set back from the street so there were no streetlights shining through. Very creepy getting out of the car in the dark, with the only light available coming through the trees from the neighboring businesses. They have a very small pool that is built in some sort of atrium like place that was in the shade of the building by 4pm.I think the biggest thing that really turned me off was the fact at breakfast the next morning and even though it was getting somewhat crowded someone had left their small terrier dog taking up one of the chairs while they went and got their food! It was pretty well behaved but even if the hotel allows pets I do not believe they belong on a chair sitting by themselves for 15-20 minutes while there are guests waiting to sit down and have breakfast!

Their staff are very friendly and helpful and attentive, making it obvious they care about customer service and have made it a top priority.One of our most favorite features about this hotel is their breakfast. It is by far the best breakfast setup I've seen in a hotel for a complimentary breakfast. You get to choose from a variety of tasty microwaveable egg sandwich or bowl or burrito type entrees, fresh fruits and yogurts, fruit juice, pancakes, and very decent coffee.

Clean and comfortable my well designed and very quiet room was ideal. We had drinks and dinner at the hotel’s restaurant our first night. Our experience at the restaurant was fine, but the menu is a bit limited and the restaurant a little too “family friendly”...very brightly lit and too much brightly colored Formica. But...for a drink or two and some re-heated appetizers it was fine.Getting to downtown was a breeze. We used Lyft and never had to wait more than 5 minutes on either end of the trip.The only real negative was it’s isolated location.

But on this quick 1-night trip, I wanted something easy and inexpensive without hassle. Thanks to TripAdvisor, I simply chose the #1 (and the rate was fantastic) and went with it. And this hotel just NAILS it. No need for me to reiterate all of the info from the previous reviews --- the hotel is just that good. For the hotel class and price point, it doesn't miss a detail. Plus it's impeccably clean and the staff is great. I will be recommending it to everyone I can!One location note -- although the name suggests it's an airport hotel and it's plenty convenient for that, it is VERY convenient for a typical Austin traveler who is ok with being out of of the Downtown/SoCo action and will receive a tremendous value as a result. I had dinner in a popular area of South Lamar the night I stayed and it only took 10 minutes door-to-door to get there. It's only about 5 or 6 miles to the heart of South Congress!

The lobby was clean and welcoming, and overall, the hotel looked nicer than other more expensive hotels I've stayed in over the years. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful as well.The rooms were spotless and the beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were nice as well, although the towels left a little to be desired (not the best quality).I only have one negative item to bring up, albeit it's not that terrible overall. On the last morning of our stay we were greeted by the housekeepers shouting conversations to each other across the hallway while cleaning different rooms. Obviously, we wouldn't expect them to clean rooms in complete silence, but this went on for at least 10 minutes right at 8:00am.Overall, this is a fantastic hotel, and its proximity to the airport can't be topped. It's also only a 10 minute drive northwest to downtown Austin, and about 15 minutes to the amphitheater and F1 race track to the southeast.

762,"Positives -1. Excellent location, within walking distance of 6th Street, Rainey Street, and the bat bridge. 6th Street includes numerous bars and live music, and is closed to traffic at night on weekends. Rainey Street also includes numerous bars, but has more outdoor bar areas. The bat bridge is a bridge where a ton of bats live and is big tourist draw, as the bats fly out from under the bridge at night. 2. Free breakfast included.3. Area is safe, and includes several quality restaurant and bar options across the street. 4. Room was clean and modern.5. Quality fitness center included.6. Property includes small outdoor pool. 7. Happy hour with free drinks offered Monday - Thursday.8. Hotel was quiet at night.9. Excellent staff. 10. Noon check out time instead of 11:00 am check out time. Negatives -1. Valet parking only, no self parking option available.2. Pool is not heated, so swimming in March is tough.3. No hot tub available.Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would recommend due to excellent location, nice staff, and free breakfast.","March 24, 2019","13    Hampton Inn & Suites Austin Downtown

768,"As others have said, this property is in a great location for walking the city. However if you have a car, be aware of the steep parking costs which seem outrageous when you are paying to stay at the property but all of the area hotels seem to be the same! This is a busy place - we were not able to get into our room until several minutes after 4pm check-in and when we requested a later check out, they were only able to give us 30 minutes due to sold out conditions. Several events were happening, including their marathon & a soccer tournament, which explains that. I did not think the front desk staff was overly helpful or friendly but rather just ok. Our room (corner room 1513) was quiet and spacious. The decor was tasteful, although somewhat heavy and dark for me. It was clean overall - the microwave and refrigerator could have used extra attention. I liked the fact that there was a dedicated recycle vs trash container, however it was too small to be super useful. The bed was comfortable, the linens especially nice, and we love the neutrogena products. The breakfast was good and provided a lot of variety. The folks working in the breakfast area did an especially nice job of keeping things full and tables clean. We did not try the on site restaurant but visited the Royal Blue Grocery store that was close by - a great place to pick up anything you could want/need!","February 21, 2019","13    Hampton Inn & Suites Austin Downtown

The hotel was clean and the staff very accomodating. The evening reception was pleasant with food, wine and beer readily available. There is a balcony where one can eat and drink on the second floor and watch the city walk by. We were particularly impressed when we had a problem with the in-room safe, apparently putting a wrong code so we couldn't re-open it. This was after hours, and the fellow capable of opening it was due to arrive at work at 8am. We were concerned since we had medications in the safe, but at 8:02 the following morning he arrived and opened the safe using a secure code and electronic device, truly excellent service to their clientele. We would definitely stay here again if visiting Austin. Only complaint is that the closet in our room was designed for Barbie clothes, very, very small, so prepare to leave some clothes hanging around the room; not sure if all rooms have such a small closet, but be aware. Otherwise, a fine choice if you want to be in the action while in a secure and pleasant establishment.","November 8, 2018","13    Hampton Inn & Suites Austin Downtown

Our bathroom tiles were loose, refrigerator did not get cold and our room keys did not work properly for interior or exterior doors even after they were replaced. Bathroom and closet were very small, with no dressers or drawers for our clothes. Several days, housekeeping left dirty rags in our room and we did not have toilet paper. The hotel was a considerable drive to downtown, South Congress and other Austin locations. The advertised ""lounge"" is several bar stools at the check in counter. Pros were comfortable beds, an awesome breakfast, ample parking and close proximity to Whole Foods.

813,"I wish I could say that our visit was a pleasant one, but unfortunately I was disappointed with the lack of safety in regards to the way the umbrellas were anchored to the tables at the pool. I was hit in the chest with the umbrella from one of those tables, and let me tell you it was painful. The umbrella pole isn’t light and is made with solid wood. I blocked it with my hand and yet it still managed to hit me. The pain was excruciating and the bruising and swelling set in the following day. I called the front desk right after it happened and maintenance came and properly screwed in two of those umbrellas and the third umbrella that didn’t have an anchor, was taken away. Another guest saw what happened to me and as the wind blew she tried to hold down her umbrella but ended up leaving for fear of getting hit. I am not sure if an apology was given, but one of the maintenance workers did later give me a $15 coupon. Which to me, was inadequate. For the price I payed for this two night stay I would expect to have a safe place to rest and play for me and my children. ","April 30, 2019","14    Hyatt Place Austin/Arboretum

(Someday hotels will learn how to have doors that don't slam every time someone leaves their room.)I booked this hotel due to its location in the Arboretum area and the price. We planned to visit local breakfast haunts and didn't want to pay for breakfasts we wweren't going to eat. However, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that Hyatt World members actually do get a free breakfast. It was fine even though we only ate there on the last morning of our six-day stay.All in all, a surprisingly good hotel and a great value.

Closet space is pretty small & there aren’t many drawers for clothes. I didn’t unpack my suitcase so i didn’t use any closet space. Sink is outside of the bathroom. I had never seen that before. As a Hyatt member I was able to get free breakfast. It definitely wasn’t the greatest but it was good. I tried to use the shuttle service but there was never anyone available to drive it which was pretty annoying. The only reason i didn’t give 5 stars is because my room was only cleaned once & i found a bug/cockroach on the sink as i was brushing my teeth! I did let the front desk know & they offered to switch my room, however, i was checking out the next day so i didn’t see a reason.Overall i would stay here again.

Check in was slow and confusing, and it took three tries to get the person checking us in to understand that all of our rooms needed to be on separate credit cards, not the card used to guarantee the reservation. Room was fine - lots of room and a nice workspace (although the outlet closest to the desk wasn't working - not a big deal). We sat down for drinks after getting back from dinner, and it took 20+ minutes for four of us to be served (after placing our order at the bar). The consensus was that the drinks were not very good = watered down and bland. Breakfast was what you expect at these chains - OK, but nothing special. All four of us had to specifically ask for a copy of the bill when we checked out. I get that the world is trying to go paperless, but sometimes you need that document.

863,"Stayed here with a friend for a yoga training. I liked that there was extra space in the room since there was a couch area so we weren't on top of each other like most hotels where there are just beds. It was close to the studio which was important. Breakfast was free but the coffee was undrinkable, so we had to go to Starbucks anyway. There were often large trucks taking up several parking spaces in the back at night which was inconvenient and made us feel unsafe to walk so far in the dark. I feel like they should have parked further away instead of taking all of the spaces near the door, but I guess the hotel can't make its guests be considerate.

The next day I asked for a new room and was once again told they were booked. I showed pictures of the dirt on my bed and the front desk said it’s no big deal.

Unlike most hotels that are adjacent to a highway, this sits off of the major roads. Made the stay even better.","June 14, 2019","16    Hampton Inn & Suites Austin Cedar Park - Lakeline

949,"‪Warning to all visiting Austin, TX. Do not stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites Cedar Park Lakeline @10811 Pecan Park Blvd. 78750. Horrible experience there! Still dealing with problems and cannot get the manager; full week of calling several times. #Hilton #hamptoninn&suites1. Mattresses hard as a rock2. Run horribly with virtually no customer service. 3. Left my medication in the room and have been trying for a full week to have them mail it to me. I got a call from a man, that was not with Hampton or Hilton that couldn't speak English very well, and wanted $50 to mail it to me! $10 trip charge, $35 shipping cost plus tax on all. Sanjay is the manager at this location and I'm assuming this person is a relative trying to make a buck on a $5.00 regular mail package. I don't understand why this Hilton property could not put the pill case in an envelope and mail it. No return calls! I will NEVER stay at this location again and as a Hilton Diamond member am seriously reconsidering Hilton Hotels in general.","January 6, 2018","16    Hampton Inn & Suites Austin Cedar Park - Lakeline

The remaining staff that we interacted with equally friendly and helpful but not quite Melinda. The property was clean and quiet with large rooms.

All of the attention to detail, like our welcome sticky note on the door, little chandeliers hanging throughout the property, sitting areas, floating water fountain in the pool, and lots of bug spray options both deet and deet-free, really showed how much love & thoughtfulness the property owners had put into this beautiful place.

968,"Casa del Sol is my favorite getaway and the best kept secret in Texas. It's hard to describe how special the vibe is -- peaceful but not boring, friendly but not intrusive, and just very, very chill. I've stayed there four times, once with my husband and three times by myself, and my husband has also been back by himself for a little solo vacay (well truthfully, he went with our dog--they're very close ;). I love all the rooms, each one is unique and charming without being kitschy, and stocked with everything you need to kick back and relax. My new favorite is the Armadillo, a little airstream that is just snug for one person and a perfect spot to get some reading or writing done. And the gorgeous private deck overlooking the lake with pool and hot tub is just a spectacular place to hang out. It's also very convenient--good restaurants and groceries minutes away, nearby trails to hike, and all the delights of Austin within a 20 minute drive. In short, when we need to get away--this is where we go.","February 6, 2019","17    Casa del Sol Bed and Breakfast at Lake Travis

989,"My significant other and I booked a trip to Austin and were researching where to stay. We found this in our research and she saw the Armadillo - an airstream trailor - and got really excited. I’m a bit of a hotel snob and wasn’t on board with it, but in her excitement, I booked it anyway and am glad I did. It was a unique experience which we greatly enjoyed.I got a call a couple weeks before from them confirming that I knew I booked an airstream trailor. I confirmed.We arrived to find a brilliantly renovated little trailor turned into a quaint hotel room. It was clean, well maintained, and well kept. It had a lot of cleverly placed storage with a mini kitchen and tiny bathroom. It has a large deck with seating for plenty of space to relax. We had access to a hot tub in their pool area and that was a wonderful part of our experience. It was too cold to access the pool.Breakfast is daily fresh pastries and fruits. It was plenty for the two of us. Some things to consider:- The bathroom is small with a tiny shower. There is only a curtain separating the bathroom from the rest.- Heat is provided through space heaters. The space heaters were plenty good for us.- You are in what seems like the hills and far from everything, but you are really a short drive from just about everything.If you are open minded and looking for a unique rustic experience, I would highly recommend. If you are looking for luxury and space, find somewhere else and prepare to pay a bunch for it.We loved it and would not hesitate to do it again.

990,"It is said that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover; well that also applies here. Casa del Sol has a beautiful website, with appealing images and well-written text. The reality is much more funky and ready for some freshening up. No amount of knick knacks and wall hangings can cover up the need for a coat of paint. Speaking of wall hangings: We stayed in the Golden Sun Cottage. Very comfortable bed and quiet surroundings made for a great sleep. But waking up to the diagonal array of three crosses on the wall next to the door was a bit weird. I am not a Christian, but the crosses did not really offend me. But I found the choice to put them there an odd one for the innkeeper to make, considering that it could be offensive to many guests. Then we entered the kitchenette to prep breakfast (a very nice selection of pastries, fruit, etc.) to see, not one, but two images of the Virgin Mary on the wall! If the intention is to provide lodging for Christian guests, that should be made clear on the website.It was also odd to have no face-to-face contact with either innkeeper (except once by phone and once via handwritten note!) through our 4-day stay. In fact the place was deserted for the first few days with no other guests.That phone call, placed upon arrival, questioned the fact that we were told when booking that they are within 20 minutes of downtown. In reality, we never made it to most sites in the city in less than 35-40 minutes. Not as convenient as we hoped.The note made a specific request for a breakfast item and it was provided promptly. But, speaking of breakfast, I believe there needs to be some rules as to what constitutes a B&B. I've stayed at many B&Bs and the range of breakfasts provided is very wide: from gourmet 3-course meals to crappy, cold pastry and cereal. Case del Sol provides an excellent continental breakfast, with quality items, and plenty of it. But is that really a B&B? Maybe. But, where's the line?As I've said throughout, on most counts Casa del Sol was a good experience. Comfortable and quiet. High-quality continental breakfast. But, although the location in Lake Travis is itself very nice, it is not convenient to downtown Austin. And it's way funkier than the website might convey!","December 7, 2017","17    Casa del Sol Bed and Breakfast at Lake Travis

You’re going to be elated or nauseated when you arrive. Fox News is on the big TV in the lobby. Lord help you if you ask to change it. I don’t know why they just can’t have something else besides cable “news” playing. Customers will be very polarized. Interstate 35 is 200 yards away, and the noise was unbearable from my original room. If you HAVE to stay here, ask for a lower-numbered room (x19 or lower) to be farther away from the din.

1012,"Staying at the SpringHill Suites was a pleasant experience. We got checked in fairly quickly, although we got 2 queens instead of 1 king. That meant we had very little space in this room for our opened suitcases and they ended up in the kitchen and under the desk. The hotel was a bit noisy because of the constant traffic on the IH-35. Speaking of which, it's a very short drive from the parking lot to the freeway and that proved quite a challenge since you have to cross 3 lanes on a busy frontage road. The 2 beds we got were comfortable, we had 2 extra pillows on each bed. The shower was hot and powerful. The toilet seat on the other hand was too loose and we reported that when we left.

1016,"First off, the positive....the breakfast was quite good and nicely stocked. The young lady who takes care of it does an excellent job. The areas were kept very clean and she was a delight. The rooms appeared clean and the beds were comfortable. I wish I could say the same about our room, overall. We booked a king and were given two doubles (not queens). We were not even told about this and didn’t know it until we arrived in our room. When we trudged back downstairs with all our belongings, we were told they were overbooked and a King was not available. We also were not happy that our room was RIGHT by the elevator but this really was not an issue at all and the elevator noise didn’t bother us. The trudging back downstairs was an issue as the elevator button for the third floor didn’t work. They did get it fixed the next day and I understand things break but this wasn’t the only issue. (Also, the elevators were pretty dirty and slow.) The ice machine on our floor didn’t work so we had to go to the first floor for ice. This was not fixed. Nor was the air conditioner/heater in our room. It took forever to heat the room and once it came on, it never shut off automatically. So we were either too hot or too cold. Speaking of too hot, weirdly, we had no cold water at either of our sinks. It took a while for the water to ever warm up but, once it did, it was burning hot and there was no way to adjust it down. I mean, NOTHING came out when the faucets were turned all the way to the right. We mentioned these issues on our way out for the day and was assured they would be addressed. They were not, nor were we ever contacted. I’m not even sure if anyone came to our room to check them out. If they had, they would have noticed the room was not made up, even though we were out of the room by 10 am. And no, we didn’t hang the be green notice on the door (but did hang up our towels to be reused the next day ). Also, the refrigerator did not seem very cold but we didn’t really use it all that much. We did receive an apology from the desk clerk when checking out but it did not seem like he really cared all that much. We travel a lot and understand things happen but this was a pretty long list. And we really expected more from the Marriott name. ","December 5, 2018","18    SpringHill Suites Austin South

They had already charged me online. She said oh no that would come off it's just a hold. One week later I called And said this is a charge will you refund it please they said we will after having a long conversation. Well, 2 months later after 3 more times calling talking to the manager NAME TAYLOR ( he kept me on the phone for 45 minutes on hold on March 9th, 2018 ) Still there is no refund.

1029,"We truly enjoyed our stay at the Austin South Springhill Suites. Now that I am retired I have high expectations as I spend my own money vs. my companies money on lodging. This hotel exceeded my expectations with their excellent service and hospitality. Our check in was handled by Foteini who was very friendly and hospitable. She did well to recognize my status as a Gold Member of Marriott Rewards and thanked me for my loyalty to Marriott. She found a commonality for conversation and building of rapport during our check in, she used our name 3 times during the check in. She explained the amenities of the hotel including the times of the breakfast. The front desk was always very friendly and greeted us every time we entered the hotel as well as departed using our name numerous times. Another associate at the desk that we would like to recognize for her hospitality is Hannah. Our guest room was spotless clean and everything was in working order. The bed was comfortable and the linens crisp. Wifi worked great in both our room and in the lobby.Kinja was our room attendant and although we never met her she kept the room clean. The breakfast buffet was pretty much Springhill standard. We were dissappointed that they ran out of bananas a couple of times during our 4 day stay. The buffet attendants worked hard to keep the buffet stocked with supplies and replenishing food. When engaged they smiled and carried on a conversation with you while restocking. 4 miles to Congress Avenue makes this a convenient short hop to Austin city as well as only 8 miles to the Airport. The hotel is next to a full service Marriott where you can enjoy a drink at the bar and sign it to your hotel room.My only complaint is that they no longer have any copies of the USA Today for guests. For me I just walked over to the Marriott and grabbed a copy for my persual. All in all, a great stay and we can highly recommend this hotel.","March 8, 2018","18    SpringHill Suites Austin South

The music on was soothing but when looking on the bed there were black marks on the sheets and the pillows, maybe indicating that the sheets or cover were not washed properly or replaced. The house keeping lady “Issef” or something was very nice and quick to respond to a request. The breakfast was okay but did also not provide shuttle service which is fine.

1041,"I write this while sitting in the room. We booked the King suite with sofabed including our 2 kids. The facility is fairly updated and recently renovated.1. The tiniest room I've ever been in... no room to walk around the king bed. Once the sofabed is pulled out there is no place to walk around - we had to climb over the pulled out sofabed to get to the other side which is where the king bed and bathroom are.2. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is no place to put your clothes and stuff. When we mentioned it to the front desk they said we can put things in the closet - which was about 3 feet wide and had just a couple of hangers. Do I put underwear, t-shirts, etc on hangers? The guy at the front desk said there was a table in the room! Really! Put my clothes for 4 on the table next to the mini fridge?3. At time of booking we booked 2 adults and 2 kids. Yet, when we returned from dinner really late our first night and opened the sofabed there were no sheets, pillows, etc. When I called the front desk, they said I could come down and pick them up at the front desk. If they knew (and saw) 4 guests, they should have made sure there was enough bedding for all 4 guests!Needless to say, we will never come back to a Springhill. This was my first stay and will be my last! I would rate this space zero if I could. Surprised that folks rated it 5 stars...","January 10, 2018","18    SpringHill Suites Austin South

The room was spacious and comfortable, with a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker (although coffee was also available in the lobby 24/7). Our only minor complaint about the room was the lack of drawers which would have come in handy during our 6-night stay. The free internet was speedy and the free breakfast was quite extensive. The hotel was close to the airport and shopping, and we were able to complete a number of day trips while our daughter was working. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

1047,"The hotel, overall, is clean, and the location is good. However, I guess when I was looking for rooms, I missed that the rooms here are not really suites. Guess I’m old fashioned, but when I was growing up, a Suite meant there really was two rooms - with a door between. I would call these studio suites. Since my wife goes to bed early, I couldn’t watch TV. Kept the light off and just read on my iPad. Now, with that in mind, like I said, the hotel is clean, and the staff members were nice and pleasant. Everything in the room was clean and worked as it should. Bed was comfortable. Dressing area is small, so don’t try getting two people ready at the same time. We skipped housekeeping two of the three days, but the third day the room was clean. Breakfast was so-so, but that could have been because it was Thanksgiving week and it was crowded. The ladies working the meal were really earning their pay. The book detailing the hotel said there were daily newspapers, but we never saw one. A small peeve of mine was that they don’t sell Coca Cola products. Had to do with Dr. Pepper. So, if you don’t need a true suite, then this would be a good place to stay and I would recommend it. Stay weird, Austin!","November 26, 2017","18    SpringHill Suites Austin South

1060,"So I travel a great deal, and I generally choose Marriott properties. My expectation is 1) they are clean, 2) they have good customer service, and 3) they make an honest effort to recover - if there is an issue. I also use Hilton, Hyatt, and Sheraton (now also Marriott) properties, so I do make it a point of complaining if an issue is askew. This property had human body hair in the bathroom, It also smelled musty and had a fragrance used to 'mask' the musty smell. I tolerated it, since I had a late night and early morning, and left, responding to the questionnaire from GM Mike Montgomery honestly - well, unlike other Marriott properties, he replied with a form letter which said he would 'bring it up with the staff'. No offer of points, nor anything else.Anyone interested is welcome to reach out for electronic copies of our chat.So, Montgomery does not respond like other Marriott brands have responded.

Front desk was helpful and provided us a list of restaurants when we asked where to go to lunch. Easy parking. At breakfast, they had an ADORABLE Texas-shaped waffle maker. The only negative is that the signage at the entrance was definitely lacking. They had 2 red flags but otherwise no big sign or flowers or anything that would indicate the entrance to a hotel. We sailed right past it, even using a gps because the entrance was so non-descript. It required a couple of awkward turns and added 5 extra minutes with the traffic light and odd separate left hand turn lane to get our way back to the entrance, so be on the lookout when you're driving there for the first time.","July 1, 2019","19    Hampton Inn Austin/Oak Hill

1073,My wife and I stayed here three nights on our trip to Austin and the hill country. The downtown lodging seemed overpriced so we chose this because of its location outside of the downtown and it was actually very easy to make a couple trips into the city. We felt this was a good value. We had a nice room on the third floor with comfortable bed and overlooking the pool which is the quiet side away from street traffic. We had their complimentary hot breakfast and each day it was different. There's a lot of lodging to pick from and I would recommend this one. ,"April 17, 2019","19    Hampton Inn Austin/Oak Hill

Amenities included Neutrogena products, and even had makeup remover wipes which I have never seen in a hotel before. Nice touch!

Buffet was plentiful - included eggs (scrambled or boiled) and sausage, make your own waffles, oatmeal, cereal, toast and english muffins. 2 blends of coffee as well as decaf and apple and orange juice. Tons of places to eat and shop nearby, and several breweries also very close. I would stay here again, and would recommend to others.

1121,"We have stayed at this hotel many times but it had been a few years since our last visit. For the most part it is a very nice place to stay. I just noticed a few nits (many of you will think I'm just being petty here) that made me pause. To start with, I don't know why they can't give you a soap dish at the bathroom sink. It really bothers me for the soap to slide all over the counter. It also bothered me that the tissue in the box provided started out white but became blue during our stay. It was the same box because we didn't have the room serviced for our stay. That means they are refilling the tissue instead of putting out new boxes. That makes my skin crawl a bit. Finally, the main reason I am only giving 4 stars was the last night we were there, at 2:45 am, the fire alarm sounded. We jumped out of bed and opened the door to see if it was just the alarm in our room, it wasn't the hallway alarms were sounding as well. We started to get dressed and the alarm silenced. I called the front desk and after some time I was told it was a false alarm. We later found out it was a disgruntled would be guest who pulled the alarm on his way out after being denied a room. Now, I know this was beyond the control of the hotel staff but I expected some sort of an apology. I have stayed at hotels where the fire alarm was activated and the staff went out of their way to apologize. I have stayed at hotels where the power went out and the staff went out of their way to apologize. I expected more than a cursory ""Thanks for staying with us. Have a great day."" when we checked out.","May 28, 2019","20    Hilton Garden Inn Austin Northwest / Arboretum

The vandals broke two of our car windows and wrecked the metal of the door frames with a crowbar (our guess). Another car was also broken into. The staff did not seem surprised. The hotel has no security cameras. Staff gave us a free breakfast and helped us vacuum the glass out of our car, but we had to drive home to Allen, TX, with 2 broken windows. Thankfully, the weather cooperated. Several items were stolen, but most of our valuables were in the hotel room with us. We understand that the hotel isn’t responsible for the break in, but if this is a common occurrence, they need to upgrade their security.

There were just a few things that would have made this the PERFECT visit for us... everyone has their own opinion so take mine for what it is worth. First, the beds were harder than usual. They changed the beds to have wooden side slats and frames... they were not the most comfortable accommodations. Second, the towels were rough and stiff. It was like they had not been used in a while, maybe got damp from steam, then air dried. Finally, eggs were watery and no grits.

1171,"We stayed 3 nights over the 4th of July weekend and overall it was great!! PROs: We are family of 4 with children ages 5 and 7. So, the two bedroom suite was perfect! King sized bed and full bathroom downstairs and queen sized bed and full bath upstairs made our stay very comfortable. The stairs are very steep so people with younger children may want to be cautious. The beds were comfortable despite many reviews saying they were not. Breakfast is vegetarian but very tasty. There is a rotating menu with 3 items to choose from but they always have biscuits and gravy, oatmeal and other bread items. They also have fresh fruit. I found the breakfast to be a thoughtful touch to this hotel. The evening reception is very nice! Drinks and snacks from 5-7pm most days. The price is very reasonable!!The hotel grounds are clean and very quiet and peaceful. The staff were attentive and courteous! Thank you!!CONs: The rooms themselves are VERY outdated. There were huge cracks in the bathroom tiles. The sinks come up to your thighs and I am not tall at all. The shower is very strange-the hot water never really got hot and the nozzle didn't work properly. The shower head is very low with light water pressure. The appliances all work but are very old school. I didn't even know how to use the microwave honestly. It had dials on it. The TV was fine but no access to apps which is not a big deal but I was hoping to catch up on some Netflix.The pool is nice but small so gets crowded easily.The hotel is in a very run down area so nothing is within walking distance.Overall, the experience was nice. For me, the pros definitely outweighed the cons. I likely will not return unless they update. I don't regret going at all.

During our stay, the pool water was covered in debris (including dozens of large beetles). I skimmed as much off as I could so my kids could enjoy the pool, then checked the filter pot and it was completely filled with debris. I'd advise the hotel management to clean the pool more thoroughly and frequently, as it's pretty unsavory for guests.Overall, I love the concept, and it's walking distance from a Tesla Supercharger which is convenient.

It seems like the area is really up and coming and will maybe have more restaurant options in the future. I absolutely loved that my stay was essentially waste free since even the napkins at breakfast were cloth! Breakfast was probably the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. Each guest gets a ""main dish"" option with your typical buffet offerings as well. So glad the coffee was fair trade and from a local coffee company.

I had a friend come by to have a glass of wine with me and it would have been nice to have the fine wine out of an actual wine glass. So maybe providing a couple in the room?.

I enjoyed the availability of vegetables as well as gluten free bread as options for breakfast. I was able to put together a well rounded breakfast that met my dietary restrictions. My only complaint was that the bed pillows were all very thick. I did not ask at the front desk if they had different pillows as I was able to use a sofa pillow.

1229,"In Austin to visit family for Mother’s Day weekend, we got a good online deal on this hotel. We did not know before booking the room that Wyndham had acquired La Quinta’s brand in 2018. But upon arrival Wyndham’s influence was evident. In our experience, LQ has usually been a safe, clean moderately-priced option for lodging on the road, so we would’ve likely booked it no matter what, and we have no way of knowing what the property was like before the Wyndham buyout, but this place was genuinely the nicest LQ property we’ve stayed at anywhere.The lobby area/front desk was clean and well-appointed. Modern and bright, it offered a great first impression of the hotel. The check-in process—primarily completed and paid for online—was easy and painless…and the hotel staffers in the area were very friendly and engaged us in nice conversation. They accommodated our early arrival too. (Check-in time is 3 pm CT.)Still, the first impressions and friendliness of the staff won’t cover up a bad room for long…so we were anxious to see the accommodations. Room 253, on the courtyard (interior) side of the hallway, was our destination and it was not a disappointment. The room itself seemed big and not cramped. The design of the room provided for good room for two double beds while still leaving plenty of room for movement by a couple of folks sharing the space. A nice desk/work area was situated in a corner next to a window, which was a nice touch. Anyone actually having to do work from the room would have the luxury of pulling back the curtain and taking advantage of the view.The mattresses on the beds were a little bit softer than we usually like—but our tastes are for firm beds. But these were not mushy by any stretch of the imagination and very easy to sleep on. TV was mounted on a swivel base to make it easy to watch from any corner of the room. Channel selection was limited, though…don’t go looking to spend time surfing a ton of cable channels. There was also a room refrigerator and coffee maker.The bathroom was roomy and clean. The shower provided a strong flow of water and plenty of hot water too. However, the toilet did make an odd sound (possibly air in the pipes??) when flushed. It wasn't a one-time deal either. It wasn't a problem for us, but we could see how it might be a nuisance for someone who needed to take care of business in the middle of the night while others were sleeping.The property itself is located adjacent to The Domain, an upscale shopping/dining/entertainment/residential/office area on the north side of Austin. If you were coming to town for a getaway weekend, this hotel is literally within walking distance of some nice retail shops, restaurants and movie theater. We had tickets to the Round Rock Express baseball game at Dell Diamond and the location of this property made it very easy to get to and from the stadium in approximately 15-20 minutes each way (although it might take longer if you look to avoid toll roads).Since we do have family in the immediately vicinity, we frequently travel to Austin. And we will definitely be booking this spot again when we do. Great experience!","May 13, 2019","22    La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Austin Near ...

1260,"My wife and daughter and one of our dogs accompanied me for a two-day stay at the hotel. We arrived late in the evening, but it didn't matter as the front desk had everything all ready for us and we were able to check-in quickly. The front lobby was well lit especially for that time of night, almost midnight. Every aspect of our stay at the hotel was positive. The only complaint and this is just from being spoiled at staying at other, more expensive hotels, was that the room seemed a tad smaller than I would have expected. I am probably way off, but it was my perception. Everything was clean, I didn't worry much if I didn't put something on my feet when walking around the room. I will definitely stay here again and make it the hotel of choice when I have to stay in Austin when accompanied by any of our animals as you can walk right out of the lobby, in to The Domain and find some excellent food, plenty of shopping, and just a very pleasant place to walk around, away from the hustle and bustle of the city itself.","October 12, 2018","22    La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Austin Near ...

It’s a no frills hotel. It has a small gym with a treadmill, a stationary bicycle, weights and another out of order machine. It has an outdoor pool, don’t know if it’s heated. The following day, we took the hotel shuttle to the airport. It’s a nice hotel, friendly staff and very close to the airport.Highly recommended if you need to be near the airport.

1320,"When my husband and I made a quick trip to Austin for a fundraiser, I was a little dismayed to see that he had picked a hotel near the airport. Usually I like to be somewhere within walking distance of shops, restaurants, etc. The hotel shuttle picked us up within 10 minutes and the ride to the hotel was short. The front desk staff was welcoming and friendly and very informative. Our room was clean and comfortable and very quiet. When we asked about local restaurants we found that there was only one within the three mile distance the free hotel shuttle can take you. Since we are explorers, we decided to walk a few blocks each way and see what we could find. We found a bus stop within half a block of the hotel and my husband checked his phone for a schedule as advertised at the stop. Since it was our first night in town, we decided to not venture much further and out of curiosity went to the the JD Market #5 just across from the hotel on E. Riverside Dr. To our delight, there was a hot food bar with delicious tacos, enchiladas, and sautéed vegetables. There was a Mexican bakery, snacks, fruit and full strength beer and wine. We ordered take out dinner and bought a bottle of wine for a delicious, relaxing first night in our hotel. All rooms are equipped with dishes, flatware, glasses, etc. After a wonderful and varied breakfast the next morning, we took the bus into downtown Austin and started the weekend. We didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn the day we left as the hotel shuttle took us straight to our airline gate. We also took advantage of the ""Uber"" type rides offered; check the front desk for a $5.00 off your first ride card.

Great for relaxing after a long drive day or getting out of the room if you're here for a while. We especially enjoyed the size of the rooms. Ours was a suite with a couple TVs, DVD player. couch, desk/work station and then a separate bedroom. The beds were super comfy and the kitchen had a enough room to actually cook in. With that said, why cook when you don't have to! Staybridge offers a complimentary evening meal during the week. We enjoyed the salad bar and meatball subs after we checked in. There were also dessert options, coffees, teas, and sodas available. There was even beer and wine available -- on the house! This place offers a lot, but one thing to note in particular is how close it is to the Austin Airport. We're talking 5 mins. Great if you've got an early flight or late arrival.

Great workout room, nice outdoor area with good seating and bbq grills - didn't use grill, but did enjoy just sitting outside in this area. Available fruit infused water was delicious; lots of beverage options available 24/7. Breakfast selections were varied and quite good. The decor was very recent, cheery and colorful.

1337,Shaira did a fantastic job at check in. She accommodated my request for a 1st floor room which was very appreciated. She always smiled and said hello when I walked by. Charles was the most personable maintenance person I've ever seen at a hotel. It's obvious he took pride in his work and he even came outside when I was loading up disappointed to see me leave and took the cart back into the hotel for me. Jarroe the night auditor was also very friendly and we frequently talked in the mornings. The hotel was fantastic for me.

1346,"I could happily stay here for a week. Whoever designed this room must have sat around for days thinking, “Is there anything else we could possibly add that people might want?” Large refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, dishes and silverware...more storage space in the room and bathroom than I can remember seeing in a hotel...good lighting...plenty of outlets...great air conditioning...wonderfully soft sheets...nice staff! Breakfast was not as extensive as some but it was good and there were plenty of choices. I saw a reviewer complaint about airplane noise but our room was very quiet. A minor issue is that the pillows were a little bunchy because they seemed a bit big for their pillow cases. Also, there are not many restaurants nearby and if you arrive at rush hour, you may not want to re-enter that mess to go find one. The hotel staff recommended Javi’s, a Tex-Mex restaurant that we enjoyed. Listen carefully to the directions to get there though. It’s only across the freeway but if you get in the wrong turn lane, like we did, you could be there the rest of your life. It’s only because of the kindness of strangers that we finally escaped. :) Another staff recommendation was the restaurant inside the nearby Hilton Garden Inn, which gets good reviews on TA. A suggestion would be to offer guests a menu to see, especially since it’s in one of their sister hotels. But bottom line: Home2 Suites is a marvelous hotel near the airport that more than exceeded our expectations. Way to go, Hilton!","February 7, 2019","24    Home2 Suites by Hilton Austin Airport

Surprised both me and them I am sure. Went back to desk had to wait like 3 minutes for someone to appear. Got it resolved was given a second room that had a connector door. I hate rooms with connector doors. Anyway they finally got me a room that was fine. When asked about the room mix up the clerk said well the people in that room extended it and we just found out. Hmmm Anyway hotel was nice and quite with clean rooms. Breakfast was ok no issues other than you never see any breakfast staff and also they let the tables stay dirty with used dishes.

Maybe it’s been an issue for people to leave cars parked onsite for long periods?

The room we stayed in on our arrival night had an a/c unit that made a high pitch whistling sound every time the unit turned off, so that did take a while for us to adjust to, but eventually we slept through it. We alerted the management as we checked out, so hopefully they were able to fix the problem. Erkan at the front desk went above and beyond to help us with a shuttle situation and we were able to arrive in plenty of time for our 6am flight, in spite of the shuttle arriving late due to car trouble. He was super friendly and helpful. On our return night, we got a different room, and I can happily report the a/c unit was quiet, so we got a good night's sleep. The shuttle that night was broken down, but the hotel paid for our cab ride, so I can say the company does a great job of getting you to and from the airport, no matter what their shuttle situation is. I would definitely recommend this hotel for travelers who need a nice place to crash before or after an airplane trip!","June 5, 2018","24    Home2 Suites by Hilton Austin Airport

1380,"We spent 3 nights at this relatively new hotel near the Austin airport. The staff were all cheerful and helpful, with Zed on the front desk in particular going out of his way to make us feel welcome. That said, the hotel does have some issues which bothered us. The room air conditioners are window units which are mounted right at bed level, with no way to adjust direction of air flow. We asked about options for diverting air flow and were told there was nothing they could do other than move us to a suite -- which they did at no charge, which was great. The suite had window units in both rooms with separate thermostats which I assumed would rectify the problem. However we never did understand how they worked as we turned off the unit in the bedroom but it still came on intermittently throughout our stay anyway, with no apparent correspondence or coordination to when the unit in the other room would come on. The other issue we had was with the seemingly poor construction of the building as we heard kid(s) in the room above ours running and jumping for prolonged periods of time. I called the front desk twice and Zed reported making trips to the room above both times, but with limited success. Thankfully the running and jumping stopped after several hours -- probably from the offenders being worn out -- but it was very annoying while it lasted. The hotel gave us bonus Hilton points for our experience as a token of apology, which was very nice. This was also an advance purchase stay for which we were overcharged two nights, but they refunded the difference when we called this to their attention. So they are definitely trying hard to please and earn a good reputation and the reason I gave them something higher than an ""average"" rating!","June 2, 2018","24    Home2 Suites by Hilton Austin Airport

1419,"A few friends wanted to have a ""Domain Night"" where we could visit a few places in the Domain and have a some adult beverages and stay as late as we wanted and not worry about driving home to our husbands. We planned out a trip and apparently Domain hotels fill up fast, but this hotel had a few rooms on a night we were all free. It wasn't as close to the restaurants as we wanted but we figured it wouldn't be too embarrassing to just take an Uber to cross the street. Anyway, after making the reservations online, I called to make sure we could get the rooms next to each other. There were five of us so we got two two queen bed suites and were told we could not get an adjoining room since one of the rooms was not a king but she told us would do her best to save two rooms next to each other. The day of our trip, I called again and they already had saved our rooms next to each other. One of the members of our group got there about 4:30 to check in and the front desk staff couldn't have been nicer. As each person arrived, they were met with the same friendly attitude. The rooms were just as nice. They were very roomy and smelt delightful. There were plenty of accommodations too. You could tell that everything was clean. The beds were supper comfortable and I slept like I hadn't in years. The air conditioner did a great job. There was no noise from outside the room that was noticeable even though we were slightly near the elevators. I thought about having breakfast but when I went down, it was rush hour and I didn't feel like waiting but everything on the breakfast bar looked neat and no food messes anywhere around. Overall, we had a really nice time and enjoyed our stay.

1420,"So...Smart travelers, you can either stay in a hotel, a motel or Home 2 by Hilton and enjoy all the warmth of you home. It only make sense, right? We chose a Queen Suite which came with a full size refrigerator, microwave oven, dishwasher work station/desk, WiFi and a sleeper sofa which was great for watching TV. We chose this hotel because we were traveling with family from out-of-town. This Home 2 Suite was less than 30 minutes outside of Houston Hobby airport and not far from Kemah, TX, a ""Must"" for relaxing, dining and enjoying family time. A full breakfast was included in our stay and served in a spacious dining area. Though we don't smoke, there is a very nice area outside with couches to accommodate guests. I used the fitness center, which was cleaner than our gym at home.

Even though there was someone in the adjacent unit with a dog, I never heard a peep from them. +1 for good construction.The included breakfast buffet was another major convenience which allowed me to get a quick bite before I headed out to the office.

Breakfast options are quite good and just enough, filling. 1BR Suite is spacious, clean, with full kitchen with all appliances, even a DW. Full sized fridge and freezer. Plenty of cabinet and counter space. Dishes, and not the cheap plastic patio kind either, sets of glasses including wine, pots pans bowls, large micro. Coffee maker and not the usual single serving kind either, rather you can make a pot/12 cups. Beds are comfortable. Vanity space outside of bathroom/shower. Two TVs. Comfortable sofa/sofa bed. Just really very comfortable and relaxing and I see no reason for guests not to give SBS a try, seriously.","December 16, 2018","26    Staybridge Suites Austin North - Parmer Lane

Location was very good if you want to stay close (15 min away) to main attractions in Austin but far from weekday’s traffic at downtown. Staff was always friendly, courteous and attentive since check-in to checkout. The suite was super comfortable: you have a kitchen with all basic appliances, a mini- living room to hang out and watch TV (good cable choices), the room was big enough for the 4 of us not to feel claustrophobic at any time, WiFi was fast, queen beds were super comfortable. Breakfast was included with reservation, and it was very good. I think there were some supper options for a fee but we were usually out at that time. All in all, it was a great stay.

They thought it was awesome, especially the texas shaped waffle maker. Nice having a laundry room available on first floor. Staff was extremely friendly.","June 5, 2018","27    TownePlace Suites Austin Round Rock

1511,Couldn't ask for more; Margaret and team made me feel at home immediately. The room was exceptionally clean and modern looking. You can kick back and relax in the pool or cook-out if you want--almost like being at home.,"March 20, 2018","27    TownePlace Suites Austin Round Rock

1512,"Marriott is my chain of choice, but I usually stay at a Residence Inn when I deploy for business. My trips are normally 30 days or more, so I'm looking for amenities and comfort during my 12-14 hour days, 7 days per week. My needs consist of a clean, very comfortable bed, an accessible bathroom, and if possible, room to navigate around my lodging with a rolling walker, because of my diminished mobility. This was my first TownePlace property, and because of my wonderful experiences here, I may choose not to go back to the Residence Inns around the United States.The rooms are spacious and bright, very clean and updated, and the King sized Marriott bed is legend for complete comfort and a great night's sleep. Because I had requested an accessible room, I was pleasantly surprised to find all of the furniture, cabinetry and kitchen utensils located within reach of anyone traveling alone needing to reach things from a wheelchair. Pots, pans, plates, and all dinnerware were conveniently located at a level about waist high on a standing person. The specialized cabinetry allows a person seated in a wheelchair or rolling walker to pull up underneath the kitchen and bathroom sinks, and be comfortable using these facilities. However, should you not have a disability requiring these amenities, you would not be uncomfortable in this room either. Even the garbage disposal can be worked from a seated position. There is a wonderful, pull out table/desk in the oversized room, about 5 feet by 3 feet, that quickly pushes out of the way to allow for wheelchairs, luggage, a 60 pound dog and a 15 pound cat. Yes, we're a traveling business family.The bathroom has to be approximately 15X10 feet with a roll-in shower, solidly placed grab bars on each wall as well as in the shower, and an attached, fold down shower chair that swings out of the wall for quick use with just one hand. The whole room is done in non-slip ceramic tile, and two floor drains installed so that any water escaping the shower area will quickly drain away and the floor will be safe to use barefoot. It is an AMAZING bathroom, and one of the many reasons that I have stayed here for the past 5 months. (And will continue to stay until my job is completed in August. That will be a whole year!)Just when you thought that this pet friendly, new property couldn't get any better, let me mention the wonderful, outdoor firepit area out front, where you can spend a lovely Texas evening or two sitting around the fire and/or using the huge Weber gas grill put there for guest's enjoyment. There is a nice sized, outdoor pool behind the property, fully equipped with both in-pool stairs and a motorized chair on the pool deck, allowing for people with disabilities that might not be able to have entrance or egress to the pool any other way. The fenced pool area comes completely stocked with very comfortable lounge chairs ringing the pool. Rather spend your time indoors? OK, overlooking the pool is an indoor workout room, but I have admit that I have yet to try it out.There is a nice breakfast in the morning, and it smells delicious. But, again, if I can spend another 20 minutes in that bed, I'm never going to know delicious breakfast actually might be.All that's left to talk about now is the staff, and I can promise you that you'll not find a better one anywhere. From Thomas, the General Manager, on down to Maria who is in charge of Housekeeping, there is nothing that you could possibly want/need that these folks can't provide. Amanda greets you by name as you walk in the door, Jeremy makes sure that you get a slice of his pizza when you didnt get lunch, and Ms. Jody will give you sage advice on what may be making your pet behave strangely after arrival. Joel, the building engineer, singlehandedly brought my belongings to my car when I went home for 2 weeks at Chistmas. By far though, I'll have to admit that Ms. Margie and her husband Robert are the two people that have made this stay memorable. Margie has done all that she can to help acclimate my pets to TownePlace, and Robert unselfishly takes my aging dog out 2 or 3 time per night so that I can get some well needed sleep. They both brought my belongings back into the hotel for me when I returned, all without being asked, while I made my way back to my room with my pets. WHERE do you get service like this????I'm telling you, if you're in the Austin area, and you don't spend at least one night at this property, then you're missing out on a really great stay. Do yourself a favor and make your registration today.","January 27, 2018","27    TownePlace Suites Austin Round Rock

1513,"This hotel has great employees, from Thomas (GM),JoDee (Director of sales),Joel (Maintenance), Maria,( Housekeeping) and Barbara who cleaned our room, Cecilia and Ana, (breakfast staff) to all the Front desk personnel, including Margaret, Jeremy, Amanda, Margie, and many other employees at this fantastic hotel, all made an unpleasant time in our lives more bearable. Friendly faces speaking our names with kindness and always a smile on their faces helped to make our days here a little brighter despite the circumstances we found ourselves in. My elderly parents lost their home and car in Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters. I drove them here from the Houston area because my hometown was flooded by Harvey as well. Both IH-10 and highway 90 were flooded from Houston into Jefferson County so I was unable to get my parents from the Houston area (after they were rescued) to my home. This, of course, also meant that I couldn’t return to my own home either. Consequently, we ended up fleeing the greater Houston area to the Austin area, where we have been ever since we left their area. We have now been here in this area since September last year and my parents home is still being repaired !Now let’s discuss the hotel itself. This hotel is beautiful inside and out and has a smart TV in the room. There is outdoor furniture and a grill in front of the hotel. Furthermore, there is a nice fire pit in front of the hotel too. We are staying in a handicapped accessible room so there are handicap bars in the bathroom on the walls and in the handicap accessible bathtub/shower. Also, in our room there is a two burner stove top built in the countertop, a vent hood, a microwave on the countertop, a dishwasher,and a full size refrigerator too. There are also kitchen cabinets on the wall, a sink area with a disposable and countertops all the way down to the refrigerator. There is a coffee pot in the kitchen, a toaster, dishes, pots and pans, silverware and other kitchen items in the drawers and cabinets. This hotel also have a nice workout area on the first floor and an outdoor swimming pool as well. Furthermore, there is plenty of space to walk your pets around the hotel and they provide doggy bags to clean up after your pet ( and garbage cans below the waste bags to throw the bags in too). They have several Tesla charging areas on the backside of the hotel where you can plug your car in to charge (if you have such a car and are staying at this hotel).If you need anything while you are here, the staff is great so they will try to accommodate your wishes ! There is a map on one of the walls with things like the location of a grocery store close to this hotel clearly marked on the map. This new hotel is beautiful, very safe, in a great location, has the latest tech in the rooms (you can plug then charge your cell phones with a cable). Furthermore, their technology is top notch too because their elevators require you to scan your room key card in the elevator to travel to the 2nd, 3rd or 4th floors.If you want to stay at a beautiful hotel, with great technology, in a great location, with fantastic customer service, then this is the ONLY hotel you should stay at when you are in this area. Take my word for it because after 5 months you get to know the employees and I have observed that working in this hotel is not just a job to them. Every employee shows their commitment to excellence by their work ethic in this hotel. Their actions here have shown me that they are commited to serving all customers; whether they are like my parents who are displaced Harvey survivors, business travelers, family members just having a get to together/reunion here, soccer and volleyball traveling teams and people that were just passing through this area and spending one night here, we are all greeted warmly and treated with the utmost respect no matter who we are and why we are staying in this hotel. If you stay here, I assure you that you might have checked in here as strangers but when you leave, you will leave as family!","January 13, 2018","27    TownePlace Suites Austin Round Rock

1514,"I was coming in late to check-in and called ahead to confirm my stay. A staff member, Margie, answered the phone and was pleasant and professional. Once I arrived from a long night of driving through snow storms, with a trailer in tow, I was greeted by Margie who again was very pleasant and professional in checking me in, telling me how to find the website to pay tolls (I hit a few cameras for tolls on the way in), reminding me about breakfast etc. The real issue came with my trailer. I had to park across a few parking spots to fit. Margie was helpful in having me park in the front lot so she could watch my truck and trailer while I slept. She then opened the curtains to the lobby so she could see my vehicle - she truly showed she cared. The rooms were clean and comfortable; there was a bathroom with a great shower; the breakfast was tasty etc but in the end professional helpful staff is was really makes the stay for me and Margie was top notch - Thank you Margie!","December 8, 2017","27    TownePlace Suites Austin Round Rock

We stayed one night on Thursday. One of the first few guests here and first to sleep in our room. Very clean and perfect. I expect that of a brand new hotel. Check in was flawless and easy. Room was better than expected. Room has all kitchen utensils and supplies should you need to stay here for an extended time. Being that I'm 6'4"", I appreciated the larger shower with the tall shower head. Staff is very courteous, friendly, and eager to please. Some definite kudos are the high thread count sheets (unexpected), down filled comforter, and most importantly, soft toilet paper. Not the cheap cardboard stuff you would normally get.

1540,"I made our pre-paid reservation with the Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum – Domain on October 19th 2017 for three nights at Thanksgiving. I had stayed there before and was impressed by how accessible my room was. I’m handicapped and need a roll-in shower. I made the reservation directly with the hotel so that I could verify the availability of a room with that shower. I was assured by the desk clerk that there was one available for that period and it would be saved for me.We arrived at the hotel to discover that the room I had been promised had been given to someone else. The clerk was very nice and offered us another room on the second floor with a roll-in shower. We went to the room but it was regular bathtub with a shower. He gave my husband the key to another room with what he assured us was a roll-in shower. It wasn’t. He offered us half off the room for that night and suggested we discuss the situation with the day staff. It was after midnight so we accepted.We went down the next day to talk to the desk clerk. She told us that it was hotel policy to double-book rooms! It still makes me mad to remember her saying that. I received the distinct impression that there is only one room with a roll-in shower and they double-booked it – for the entire length of our stay. We went ahead and stayed there because it was too hard to pack up again and start looking for a hotel on Thanksgiving Day. When we checked out on Saturday, my husband asked if they could give a discount for the last two nights since they had given away the room that was guaranteed. They said no. Also, we discovered the first night that the TV didn't work in the ""living room"". We reported it that night and then we stopped by the front desk the next morning. Since it was Thanksgiving, the maintenance staff wasn't working. The desk clerk discovered the outlet wasn't working so she strung an extension cord across the room. The outlet was replaced the next day.In addition, we read in our room that there is no maid service on short stays. Sure enough, our trash was emptied and towels replaced on Thursday & Friday but the room was not cleaned nor the beds made.After this review was published on the hotel's web site, we were contacted by the hotel's new manager. She offered us points but we weren't interested. She then offered us compensation for the other two nights of our stay and we gratefully accepted and I've republished this review, raising my rating from one star to three.","December 10, 2017","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

1541,"We stayed here for nearly a month on business and thought the design of the rooms was pretty good. The kitchen had a nice breakfast bar and full size fridge. The two burner stove and dishwasher made it well equipped for making light meals. We liked that the bedroom was separated from the sitting/ kitchen room. Clothing storage was nice, with plenty of closet and drawer space. The laundry basket and shelves in the closet are good pluses. The rooms were quiet enough but then someone moved in upstairs and we heard a lot of footsteps.The bathroom was a good size but would have benefited from drawer storage and another towel bar. The staff were uniformly cheerful, professional, and friendly. The breakfast and light dinners were nicely done. The only thing that bothered us was that the wireless was not good, very slow and dropped a lot. ","November 21, 2017","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

1546,"My family of 5 stayed here over graduation weekend. I'm rating it 4 stars because it only faltered in one area (see below). We will definitely stay here when we come to Austin again.Hotel: We had a great, spacious 2 bedroom/2 bath suite. Our room was clean, beds were comfortable, and it had everything we needed. The staff was very nice and helpful. They had a heated pool, full-size basketball court, and fire pit outside in a nice courtyard area with beautiful live oaks shading it. Area: Austin traffic is always frustrating, but this hotel is in a great location being right off Mopac (Loop 1), which is a less-busy north/south route through Austin than I-35, and 183 which can get you across east/west if needed. Target is right down the street, and there are several restaurants in the area, too.Cons: The only real con for us was that the hotel breakfast was not as good as other Staybridge's or other hotels in this class. They did have hot options each morning (eggs, sausage, french toast) and the typical bagels, bread, pastries, waffles, etc. However, the hotel was so busy this weekend and they were very low on everything and didn't have the breakfast area staffed well enough to keep things stocked and the trash cans were overflowing. Had the breakfast been better serviced, I'd have given it 5 stars.","May 21, 2017","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

1547,"We moved to this hotel for one night after a bad experience at another hotel. This was clean and had a nice layout. The snacks in the evening are a great deal. You can eat two full meals at this hotel (breakfast and the 'kick-back') for free. The kick- back included hot dogs, burgers with all the fixings, chips and drinks. Breakfast included the usual things like bagels and cereals and eggs and such. The parking in front of the hotel is scarce, so we had to park near the back and there were a few places where the lot dropped off steeply and there weren't curbs or anything to stop someone from rolling down a hill. You have to be careful backing out at night. Our room was on the side of the hotel with the pool and fire pit and basketball court. We could hear people talking and laughing until late in the night.( The outside area is very nice with a lot of sidewalk space, a deck with a fire pit, and plenty of seating.)Someone called the front desk to complain about the noise thinking it was us, but they were actually hearing the chatter from the outdoor area, because there were a lot of people out there making quite a bit of noise. It was frustrating being blamed for other peoples' noise. That was the only reason I couldn't give the hotel a full five rating. The hotel should have a curfew for the courtyard.

1548,"I stayed here for 5 days with friends and family. It's a great location - close to shopping, restaurants, and easy access to 2 different freeways. The staff was very friendly. The room was clean and updated. We had a one bedroom suite, and having the door separating the living from sleeping rooms was so nice with 2 teenagers that liked to sleep in. The kitchenette had a full size fridge, microwave, 2 burner cooktop (turn the timer knob on the wall to turn them on!), and dishwasher. No oven, though my friend in the 2 bedroom unit did have a toaster oven. I never heard any noise from our next-door neighbors or the hallways. My only complaint is that they seem to completely forgotten sound insulation vertically. A boys high school debate team checked in at midnight one night, including the room above us. It was unbelievably loud. It wasn't crazy teenage boy wrestling (with a son, I know what that sounds like). It was standard unpacking, walking around, talking, etc. At 1:00am, with everything else quiet, I could almost make out their conversations. It began again at 6:00am when they got ready to leave. Honestly, vertical noise transmission is a serious design flaw here.Breakfast was good, though better on the weekdays than the weekend - real plates, fresh biscuits and gravy. The laundry was free to use. We didn't use the pool, but the area looked well kept and clean.Bottom line, I'd consider staying here again, but would request a top floor room.","January 2, 2017","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

1550,"Staybridge customarily offers a comfortable and reliable hotel experience. However, those adjectives can be decidedly elastic at this property depending upon when you stay and there are some aspects where age and inattention are compromising the amenity. The location is 15 minutes north of downtown Austin but access to the freeway is simple. The immediate surroundings are pleasant and there are plenty of places to dine and shop nearby.  The good: the customary Staybridge suite experience is all there: space, amenity and convenience. Most everything was there and some (see below) of it worked as expected. There is plenty of on-site parking and a more-than-usually pleasant, shaded courtyard area with plenty of longing facilities around the pool. The included wifi worked well on all our devices. The weekday breakfast service offers a better-than-average chain hotel buffet affair which is well stocked and cheerfully serviced. The not so good: this building seems to be less than well insulated against the vertical transmission of noise. Even relatively minor noise from the suite above intruded far more than should be expected from a reasonably modern building. The ageing refrigerator in out suite was not functioning when we arrived but was replaced with another – equally antique, but working model – after we reported it. The allegedly hot water in the shower was tepid at best and even when it warmed enough for comfort was subject to sudden and unnerving surges of cold. We though that the HWS might have been overloaded as the hotel was full for the first days of our stay but it stayed that way long after the crowd had departed.The weekend breakfast service plummets to a significantly below-average production-line McBuffet affair taken on styrofoam dishes with floppy plastic cutlery accompanied by service that is surly and lackadaisical. A very disappointing throw-away experience from a hotel that exhorts guest to make an environmental contribution by re-using their towels and touts its “IHG Green Engage” credentials.We might use Staybridge Suites again but never on weekends.","October 25, 2016","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

I wasn't disappointed, the staff were excellent, Sylvia (I think was her name) checked us in and quickly resolved some confusion on the bookings. The room was clean comfortable and the giant fridge was great for storing water and beer etc. The pool was great and was fun watching hotel residents play basketball in the evening on the court. The outside BBQ was a useful area and nice to have the burgers cooked out there on the social evenings. Good local food stores and restaurants, I am returning to Austin in September and wanted to stay here again, however the recent hike in redemption points to 30,000 per night has made that now not possible, have gone to a nearby Staybridge for half the points, this is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.","June 13, 2016","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

However, the local dining options are very mediocre. So again, it was a good thing we had a car.We stayed for three nights. Staff were friendly and helpful, and overall service was fine.

The room wasn't quite ready when we arrived, but it didn't take long...maybe about 20 minutes. The room was clean and very large. I got a two bedroom suite since our daughter was with us. Aside from the guests who were above our room, it was a very quiet hotel. I would highly recommend getting a room on the top (4th) floor. Our room overlooked the parking lot but there were trees nearby to block the lights at night. The hotel has a pool, tennis/basketball court, and a large seating area with a firepit. There are also a couple of gas grill available for use. The breakfast was complimentary as well as the evening dinner buffet and drinks. Just keep in mind that the dinner buffet is Monday through Thursday only. I thought the location was ideal. It is very close to the Domain and quite a few nice restaurants. It's about 15 minutes or so (depending on the traffic) from downtown. Whenever we go back to Austin, this will be our home away from home!","July 2, 2015","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

The room was clean and everything worked as needed. I stayed in a suite which had 1 bedroom and a livingroom/kitchen. This room contained everything you would need for any length of stay. The facility is close to a lot of restaurants and shopping. You can walk to a lot of them. In order to make it down town you will definitely need to drive. The one thing I will say about this hotel is the staff is exceptional. The manager and the front desk staff truly make this hotel better than the others. They were very helpful with every request or advice for food and places to shop. They were always there to help.I definitely would recommend looking at this hotel. If you are looking to party and drink down town this might not be the best place due to distance, but for all other reasons I wouldn't look any further.","June 16, 2015","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

1577,"My boyfriend and I have stayed in quite a few Austin area hotels in the past few months, and so far, we liked Staybridge Suites the best. The hotel is classy and clean with everything you really need. The room was comfortable and well-equipped, especially in the kitchen, breakfast and the sitting area was great, and the drive to downtown Austin wasn't too terrible. We also really enjoyed the fruit-flavored water that was always downstairs. We had gone to check in straight from a hike, and I beelined straight for the water when we got there. We liked that this hotel was a little out of the way so we could get away from all the commotion in the city, but at the same time there are still stores and things around. We stayed two nights, and the price was very reasonable for everything you get. My only complaints were the A/C, which at some points of the night would kick on very loudly, but it wasn't much of a nuisance. The other issue was that our iPad would not connect to the wifi in the room, and their tech support wasn't able to assist with the issue. The tech support staff, and all other staff were very helpful and accommodating however.","June 15, 2015","28    Staybridge Suites Austin Arboretum

Samara at the front desk was able to work some magic and be a bright spot in a horrible situation. She went above and beyond her duties to do something kind and helpful for us.

1583,"We were on the fifth floor facing the IHOP on Driskill Street. I was initially concerned about street noise, but it wasn't an issue. The building is very quiet. The unit itsellf was clean and well appointed. Having a full size washer and dryer minimized the amount of clothing we needed to bring. In direct feedback to Locale I suggested that they add a plastic pitcher to make iced tea and rolls of plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Other than those items, the kitchen had the basics (olive oil, salt, pepper, coffee, coffer filers for machine and drip system, large selection of teas and assorted bagged condiments, suger, and non-sugar sweeteners, dishes, cookware, cutting boards, utensils). I noted that the Brita water filter was blinking for a filter change. I texted late in the day and got an immediate respond that it would be taken care of the next morning. I was expecting to find the filter on the counter, but when I followed up, I was told that the filter had been changed while we were out. The gym is small, but adequate. We were able to print our boarding passes in the business center. If you walk down Rainey Street you hit the walking trail by the river. Turn left to walk a loop (part shade, part sun) that takes you back over the Congress Street bridge. The loop took me almost exactly on hour to walk. Trader Joes is about a 25 minute walk away. We walked there and ride shared back. All and all, we had a great stay and I will definitely look for Locale in other cities.

The facilities were clean and modern with access to a nice gym, and awesome rooftop pool, I also saw a large communal hang out area and a business center. The rental was clean and spacious, decorated nicely, balcony, washer dryer, plenty of bedroom and bathroom and closet space, a large kitchen area great for gatherings with our group of 5. The place was stocked with all necessities, and included coffee/tea and a water filter pitcher which was a nice touch. The beds were pretty comfortable. The only minor critique would be that the shower had low water pressure, and also the pull out bed sheets had a few stains. Also, you can hear a little noise from the highway.

We walked to the Capital from here and to Sixth street—maybe 10 minutes away? Also walked home after the SoCo bridge bat flight with ease. Uber rides were never more then 5 min wait. Water pressure in the bathroom was great, bed comfortable, although we didn’t need the sofa bed so can’t speak to that. We stayed on the side facing the highway, but didn’t have any issue with highway noise—thought the windows did a good job keeping that out. Nice huge closet right off the bathroom, nice if one person is getting ready and the other still sleeping. Very clean overall, and I’m pretty picky about that. Coffee and nice selection of tea, sugars, cream provided. Really liked the shampoo and soap dispensers in the shower, appreciated that environmentally friendly touch. Even though this building is in a “party section”, there was no noise or mess from drunk people. Absolutely no noise from other apartments. This area was really fun, but we never witnessed any obnoxious behavior. Sunday afternoon was a hoot here. Bangers and Icenours had really fun bands. Super responsive to texts, got replies within minutes, actually took this place instead of another in this building based on that alone. The building seems to be a mix of vacation rentals and full time tennants, which I bet keeps it nice. The pool and gym were fabulous, super clean and well kept.

Would recommend shelling out the extra money if you can to park in the gated area. We did not and sometimes had to park on a street across from the actual building. Walk wasn't terrible distance wise, but Texas heat sucks.Room was clean except some wear in the bathtub, and was complete with a extra linens, super soft blanket, little box of condiments and tea, coffee filters, a tin of coffee, dishes, cleaning supplies, and detergent pods for the washer. The check in instructions were very clear, however some of the locks must be different for each room. For instance ours we had to re-enter the code to lock it from the outside when leaving, but the check in instructions had directions for a different type of lock. Not a lot in way of leaving instructions so we treated it like a normal hotel room.The staff were always super reachable via text or phone call and always responded. They even text to check up on you during your visit! I thought that was a very nice touch.","June 20, 2018","29    Locale Rainey Street

It was lovely to have so much space to spread out as opposed to a traditional hotel room. The residents seemed mostly young and in their 20s...very friendly and helpful with recommendations. The pool area is beautiful, it is pretty busy up there so it's more fun than it is relaxing. Our apartment was very clean and well appointed. Justin at locale was in frequent text commmunication with me ensuring all my needs were accommodated. I appreciated the customer service and knowing if I needed anything, he was there to assist.

There is a Sprouts nearby, if you are into health food. I was greeted warmly and made to feel I was expected and welcome. The check-in was quick. My room was large (actually looking like they had removed a second double bed to make room for the fairly comfortable king bed. In the corner was a small armless stuffed chair (not overstuffed and not a recliner), which looked very much out of place in that large area. The A/C was cold, good for Texas summer weather. The bathroom was a good size and probably in the last remodel, they removed the bathtub and replaced the area with a large shower. I really enjoyed this. There is a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. An ironing board and iron are in the closet behind the full-length mirror. There is an ice machine at the end of each corridor. I would have appreciated a bottle of water included but it was available downstairs for a modest price. The tap water is highly chlorinated. There is a business center with two computers off the lobby. I didn't have to use it so cannot tell you if there is any cost involved. There is an outdoors swimming pool. All-in-all, I enjoyed what little time I spent in the room and enjoyed the ease of access to the freeway and home.

1652,"Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of La Quinta. I feel their quality has been in decline for many years. However, I used Hotwire to get a cheap room for a quick trip to Austin, and when I saw I would be staying at a La Quinta, the first thing I did was to check TripAdvisor for their rating and reviews. Seeing the 4.5 overall rating and some complimentary recent reviews, I was feeling quite optimistic.While the address is in Austin, the hotel is located NNW of central Austin, so there is about a 20-25 minute drive into the downtown/Capitol/UT area, so keep that in mind. For me, it was a convenient location for my needs on this trip.When I arrived, I received a friendly greeting and quickly was on my way to my room. On entering, I noticed a musty, mildewy smell to it, but I assumed it would diminish after the AC was cranked up. On re-entering the room later that evening, I realized it had not faded, and it persisted throughout my visit. I can only assume that the AC filter had not been cleaned/changed in quite some time.The mildew smell was not the only problem with the room; it was definitely in need of some maintenance attention. The bathroom sink was missing the stopper, and the wallpaper in the bedroom was peeling. However, the most concerning issue was that the smoke detector was dangling from the ceiling by its wiring, and for whatever reason had been wrapped up in a plastic bag. I made the assumption that was the work of a frustrated prior guest, but nonetheless, it should never have been left in this condition. While other visitors have had better experiences at this La Quinta, I was disappointed.","August 20, 2018","30    La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Austin NW/La...

1656,"This is by far the best La Quinta to stay at in the Austin area. We have stayed here several times and love the professional yet very personable staff. We had the pleasure of working with Shay and Justin this trip. They remembered us from previous visits and we were glad to see that they were still there as we remembered them as well. It had been a while since we had been here so we were impressed they remembered us. They both made sure that we were well taken care of. The hotel is convenient to restaurants, entertainment, and shopping yet is quiet and peaceful at night. It is truly a hidden gem in Austin. We look forward to our next visit.","July 29, 2018","30    La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Austin NW/La...

The breakfast was better than most, it included scramble eggs and bacon,or toast with jellies,cereals,with milk,and other pastries. They also had coffee, juice, milk and different kinds of teas to choose from.

1664,"I had a recent business trip to the northwest Austin suburbs. Booked through the Southwest Airlines site to score some reward points at the same time. The rate of $125/night was a very good value for this quiet clean property in a good part of town (suburbs). General property notes: Grocery stores and restaurants are easily close by and great highway access. A Target is across the street. Lakeline Mall is about 5 minutes drive and is an upscale mall. This hotel sits on a low hill and the parking lot does not form a perfect circle around it – it is more of a horseshoe shape so be aware of this when choosing a parking spot. There are no neighboring businesses next to the hotel.Front desk: Arriving mid-afternoon, Elliott checked me in quickly and with a warm smile. He was friendly and noted that my reservation was prepaid but put a small hold on my card for incidentals. This was expected but it was still a nice touch for him to quietly note it. He also volunteered the operating hours for the daily breakfast included for all rooms. Overall, he made a good first impression for the hotel!Room: The room (Room 303) is nicely sized and had two queen beds with firm mattresses and good bed linens and pillows. The bath had ample towels (bath, hand, and washcloth) for two people. The room carpet was recent, largely clean, and in good shape. The bath had recent tile in it, which is modern and attractive. Shower pressure was very good. Counter space in the bathroom was quite generous, the bowed shower rod was exceptional in making the shower feel roomy, and I liked the Pantene shower products.A few small annoyances: the room doors on our third floor tend to have a hard time closing due to building foundation shift. I noticed that the right sheer panel was ripped so this should be replaced. The upholstered chair in the corner has some major stains on it so this is a bit of a distraction to the overall positive of the room.Housekeeping: Kudos to the staff for a job well done. I’ve made a habit of bringing a spare pair of white socks to wear in room: both to test how clean the carpets are being kept as well as to prevent tracking dirt into bed. I’m happy to report that my socks were largely clean after a two-day stay. The trash was collected each day, the towels and bath supplies replaced, and the floors were swept/vacuumed.Free breakfast: The breakfast had all of the usual suspects on it that you find in American hotels. This hotel’s items were laid out nicely at 630 AM but I’ve also learned to arrive and eat early for maximum peace – then retreat to my room as the crowd battles it out before the closing of the breakfast feedbag. Hours are 6 AM to 9 AM daily. Overall, this property is a GREAT value: clean, decently maintained, good amenities for most travelers, and at a reasonable price despite some small details to fix. I would recommend staying here if you need to stay in the northwest suburbs of Austin.NOTE: If you found this review useful, could you click on the “thank you” button below?

1665,"I stayed for the weekend to watch a rugby tournament and do some local hiking with my senior large dog. I was able to get a first floor room complete with a refrigerator coffee,wi-fi and direct access to parking. The breakfast was excellent and the front desk staff were very helpful.I arrived earlier than expected but was able to check in. I also utilized late check out. What was so great about this hotel was the walking trail around the lake just a block from the hotel. Poop bags were available and people do use them because the path was very clean. Five minutes away is Brushy Creek trail which is a beutiful large park with easy walking trails and again, dog friendly on leash.","May 7, 2018","30    La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Austin NW/La...

1680,"First night I came in I got bite by bed bugs and I barely sleep. I reported this on front desk and they told me they didn’t have additional rooms to change mine. Also they told me that they didn’t find any trace of bugs. My biggest dissapointment was that when I checked the bed, they didn’t even changed the sheets (I noticed it because the sheets had the same holes and stains in same places) When I reported this to front desk, they told me the manager wanted to talk with me in person the next day, the only think she was able to do is to give me new sheets set to change by myself. That day I got bite again. After complaining in the corporate website I got changed to a different room. I requested to change sheets every day just to make sure I don’t get bites again. After too weeks, the last day I found a dead bed bug in the bed. Took photos and sent them to the manager but never got not even an apology for this. Worst hotel experience ever specially after paying more than $1200+ for my stay.","November 8, 2017","30    La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Austin NW/La...
